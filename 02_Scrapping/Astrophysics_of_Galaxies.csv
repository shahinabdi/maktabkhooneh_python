0,Keck Integral-Field Spectroscopy of M87 Reveals an Intrinsically Triaxial Galaxy and a Revised Black Hole Mass,"['Emily R. Liepold', 'Chung-Pei Ma', 'Jonelle L. Walsh']","Accepted for publication in ApJL. 15 pages, 8 figures",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"The three-dimensional intrinsic shape of a galaxy and the mass of the centralsupermassive black hole provide key insight into the galaxy's growth historyover cosmic time. Standard assumptions of a spherical or axisymmetric shape canbe simplistic and can bias the black hole mass inferred from the motions ofstars within a galaxy. Here we present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics ofM87 over a two-dimensional $250\mbox{$^{\prime\prime}$} \times300\mbox{$^{\prime\prime}$}$ contiguous field covering a radial range of 50 pcto 12 kpc from integral-field spectroscopic observations at the Keck IITelescope. From about 5 kpc and outward, we detect a prominent 25$\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$ rotational pattern, in which the kinematic axis(connecting the maximal receding and approaching velocities) is $40^\circ$misaligned with the photometric major axis of M87. The rotational amplitude andmisalignment angle both decrease in the inner 5 kpc. Such misaligned andtwisted velocity fields are a hallmark of triaxiality, indicating that M87 isnot an axisymmetrically shaped galaxy. Triaxial Schwarzschild orbit modelingwith more than 4000 observational constraints enabled us to determinesimultaneously the shape and mass parameters. The models incorporate a radiallydeclining profile for the stellar mass-to-light ratio suggested by stellarpopulation studies. We find that M87 is strongly triaxial, with ratios of$p=0.845$ for the middle-to-long principal axes and $q=0.722$ for theshort-to-long principal axes, and determine the black hole mass to be$(5.37^{+0.37}_{-0.25}\pm 0.22)\times 10^9 M_\odot$, where the second errorindicates the systematic uncertainty associated with the distance to M87.",3
1,$\mathrm{morphofit}$: an automated galaxy structural parameters fitting package,"['Luca Tortorelli', 'Amata Mercurio']","Accepted for publication in Frontiers of Astronomy and Space Sciences, 27 pages, 8 figures",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"In today's modern wide-field galaxy surveys, there is the necessity forparametric surface brightness decomposition codes characterised by accuracy,small degree of user intervention, and high degree of parallelisation. We tryto address this necessity by introducing $\mathrm{morphofit}$, a highlyparallelisable $\mathrm{Python}$ package for the estimate of galaxy structuralparameters. The package makes use of wide-spread and reliable codes, namely$\mathrm{SExtractor}$ and $\mathrm{GALFIT}$. It has been optimised and testedin both low-density and crowded environments, where blending and diffuse lightmakes the structural parameters estimate particularly challenging.$\mathrm{morphofit}$ allows the user to fit multiple surface brightnesscomponents to each individual galaxy, among those currently implemented in thecode. Using simulated images of single Sérsic and bulge plus disk galaxylight profiles with different bulge-to-total luminosity ($\mathrm{B/T}$)ratios, we show that $\mathrm{morphofit}$ is able to recover the inputstructural parameters of the simulated galaxies with good accuracy. We alsocompare its estimates against existing literature studies, finding consistencywithin the errors. We use the package in Tortorelli et al. 2023 to measure thestructural parameters of cluster galaxies in order to study the wavelengthdependence of the Kormendy relation of early-type galaxies. The package isavailable on github (this https URL) and on the Pypiserver (this https URL).",2

The KR providesinformation on the evolution of the population of early-type galaxies (ETGs),therefore, by studying it, we may shed light on the assembly processes of theseobjects and their size evolution. Since studies at different redshifts aregenerally conducted in different rest-frame wavebands, investigating whetherthere is a wavelength dependence of the KR is fundamental to interpret theconclusions we might draw from it. We analyse the KRs of the three HubbleFrontier Fields clusters, Abell S1063 (z = 0.348), MACS J0416.1-2403 (z =0.396), and MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.542), as a function of wavelength. This isthe first time the KR of ETGs has been explored consistently in such a largerange of wavelength at intermediate redshifts. We exploit very deep HSTphotometry, ranging from the observed B-band to the H-band, and VLT/MUSEintegral field spectroscopy. We improve the structural parameters estimation weperformed in a previous work (Tortorelli et al. 2018) by means of a newlydeveloped Python package called morphofit (Tortorelli&Mercurio 2023). With itsuse on cluster ETGs, we find that the KR slopes smoothly increase withwavelength from the optical to the near-infrared bands in all three clusters,with the intercepts getting fainter at lower redshifts due to the passivisationof the ETGs population. The slope trend is consistent with previous findings atlower redshifts. The slope increase with wavelength implies that smaller sizeETGs are more centrally concentrated than larger size ETGs in the near-infraredwith respect to the optical regime. Since different bands probe differentstellar populations in galaxies, the slope increase also implies that smallerETGs have stronger internal gradients with respect to larger ETGs.",12

4,Supermassive black holes in UCDs formed from the nuclei of disrupted galaxies,"['Rebecca Mayes', 'Michael Drinkwater', 'Joel Pfeffer', 'Holger Baumgardt']","14 pages, Submitted to MNRAS",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We use the hydrodynamic EAGLE simulation to predict the numbers and masses ofsupermassive black holes in stripped nuclei and compare these to confirmedmeasurements of black holes in observed UCDs. We find that black holes instripped nuclei are consistent with the numbers and masses of those in observedUCDs. Approximately 50 per cent of stripped nuclei with $M > 2 \times 10^6M_\odot$ should contain supermassive black holes. We further calculate a masselevation ratio, $\Psi$ of the population of simulated stripped nuclei of$\Psi_{sim} = 1.51^{+0.06}_{-0.04}$ for $M > 10^7 M_\odot$ stripped nuclei,consistent with that of observed UCDs which have $\Psi_{obs} = 1.7 \pm 0.2$above $M > 10^7 M_\odot$. We also find that the mass elevation ratios ofstripped nuclei with supermassive black holes can explain the observed numberof UCDs with elevated mass-to-light ratios. Finally, we predict the relativenumber of massive black holes in stripped nuclei and galaxy nuclei and findthat stripped nuclei should increase the number of black holes in galaxyclusters by 30-100 per cent, depending on the black hole occupation fraction oflow-mass galaxies. We conclude that the population of supermassive black holesin UCDs represents a large and unaccounted-for portion of supermassive blackholes in galaxy clusters.",4

Based on the Local Geometric Index ofthe galaxies, we identify their local environments to be void, sheet, filamentor cluster. We find that the Grand-designs are mostly located in denseenvironments like clusters and filaments, whereas the Flocculents lie in sparseenvironments in voids and sheets.

This paper reports onNOEMA observations addressed to constrain the spatial scale of the CO emissionin outflow. The molecular outflowing gas is resolved in five components tracingapproaching and receding gas, all located at a distance of 2-3~kpc on the Westand East side of the active nucleus. This high velocity gas (up to v_out=~1900km/s) is not coincident with the rotation pattern of the CO gas in the hostgalaxy disk. The estimated mass outflow rate shows that with a global massoutput of $\dot{M}_{H_2}$=~139$\pm$20$~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, this powerfulgalaxy-scale outflow is consistent with the wind conserving its energy, andwith a momentum rate boost of a factor of ~30 compared to the momentum rate ofthe nuclear X-ray wind. Preliminary results from ancillary X-ray (Chandra) andradio images (e-MERLIN) are reported. While the nature of the radio source isnot conclusive, the Chandra image may tentatively trace extended emission, asexpected by an expanding bubble of hot X-ray gas. The outcome of the NOEMAanalysis and of past and ongoing publications dedicated to the description ofthe outflow multi-band phenomenology in IRAS17020+4544 concur to providecompelling reasons to postulate that an outflow shocking with the galaxyinterstellar medium is driving the multi-phase wind in this peculiar AGN.",13

Lagos']","19 pages, 16 figures - Will be submitted to MNRAS",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"In this work, we explore the connection between the gravitational wave (GW)merger rates of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) and galaxy properties. Wedo this by generating populations of stars using the binary synthesis codeCOMPAS and evolving them in galaxies from the semi-analytic galaxy formationmodel {\sc Shark}, to determine the number of mergers occurring in eachsimulation time-step. We find that large, metal-rich galaxies with high starformation rates are more likely to have gravitational wave (GW) events comparedto younger, more metal poor galaxies. Our simulation with the default inputparameters predicts a higher local merger rate density compared to the thirdgravitational wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) prediction from LIGO, VIRGO andKAGRA. This is due to short coalescence times, low metallicities and an highformation rate of stars at low redshift in the galaxy simulation, whichproduces more BBHs that merge within the age of the Universe compared toobservations. We identify alternate remnant mass models that more accuratelyreproduce the observed volumetric rate and provide updated fits to the mergerrate distribution as a function of redshift. We then investigate the relativefraction of GW events in our simulation volume that are in observable hostgalaxies from different upcoming photometric and spectroscopic surveys,determining which of those are more ideal for tracing host galaxies with highmerger rates. The implications of this work can be utilised for numerousapplications, including for constraining stellar evolution models, betterinforming follow-up programs, and placing more informative priors on potentialhost galaxies when measuring cosmological parameters such as the Hubbleconstant.",4

Compared to their fiducial model, we consider ahigher and a lower value for each one of the seven parameters. We quantify theexploration results with five metrics, including the density probabilitydistribution function ($\rho$-PDF), the filament morphology (250 $\mu$m dustemission), the $B$-$\rho$ relation, the dominant fiber width, and the ringinessthat describes the significance of the ring-like sub-structures. Theexploration forms straight and curved CMR-filaments with rich sub-structuresthat are highly variable in space and time. The variation translates tofluctuation in all the five metrics, reflecting the chaotic nature of magneticreconnection in CMR. A temporary $B\propto\rho$ relation is noticeable duringthe first 0.6 Myr. Overall, the exploration provides useful initial insights tothe CMR mechanism.",5
9,Differential Interferometric Signatures of Close Binaries of Supermassive Black Holes in Active Galactic Nuclei: II. Merged Broad Line Regions,"['Yu-Yang Songsheng', 'Jian-Min Wang']","21 pages, 17 figures, accepted by ApJ",Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Pairs of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at different stages are naturalresults of galaxy mergers in the hierarchical framework of galaxy formation andevolution. However, identifications of close binaries of SMBHs (CB-SMBHs) withsub-parsec separations in observations are still elusive. Recently,unprecedented spatial resolutions achieved by GRAVITY/GRAVITY+ onboard The VeryLarge Telescope Interferometer through spectroastrometry (SA) provide newopportunities to resolve CB-SMBHs. Differential phase curves of CB-SMBHs withtwo independent broad-line regions (BLRs) are found to have distinguishedcharacteristic structures from a single BLR \citep{songsheng2019}. Once theCB-SMBH evolves to the stage where BLRs merge to form a circumbinary BLR, itwill hopefully be resolved by the pulsar timing array (PTA) in the near futureas sources of nano-hertz gravitational waves. In this work, we use aparameterized model for circumbinary BLRs to calculate line profiles anddifferential phase curves for SA observations. We show that both profiles andphase curves exhibit asymmetries caused by the Doppler boosting effect ofaccretion disks around individual black holes, depending on the orbitalparameters of the binary and geometries of the BLR. We also generate mock SAdata using the model and then recover orbital parameters by fitting the mockdata. Degeneracies between parameters contribute greatly to uncertainties ofparameters but can be eased through joint analysis of multiple-epoch SAobservations and reverberation mappings.",2

The monitoring wasconducted on a daily basis with specially designed narrow-band filters,spanning from optical to near-infrared wavelengths ($\sim4000$ to $8000$Å)and avoiding prominent broad emission lines. We aim to measure inter-bandcontinuum time lags, determine the size-wavelength relation, and estimate thehost-subtracted AGN luminosity for this system. We used the point-spreadfunction photometry to extract the continuum light curves and measure theinter-band time lags using several methods, including the interpolatedcross-correlation function, the z-transformed discrete correlation function, avon Neumann estimator, JAVELIN (in spectroscopic and photometric mode), MICA,and a multivariate correlation function. We find wavelength-dependent lags,$\tau(\lambda)$, up to $\sim$7 days between the multiband light curves of MCG08-11-011. The observed lags are larger than predictions based on standardthin-disk theory by a factor of $\sim3-7$. We discern a significantly steeper($\tau \propto \lambda^{4.74}$) size-wavelength relation than the $\tau \propto\lambda^{4/3}$ expected for a geometrically thin and optically thick accretiondisk, which may result from the contribution of diffuse continuum emission tothe flux. These results are similar to those found by previous continuumreverberation mapping campaigns.",6

Current and upcoming JWST imagingwill potentially detect galaxies out to $z \sim 20$, creating a new urgency inthe quest to infer accurate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) for individualgalaxies from their spectral energy distributions, as well as masses, ages andstar formation rates. Here we illustrate the utility of informed priorsencoding previous observations of galaxies across cosmic time in achievingthese goals. We construct three joint priors encoding empirical constraints ofredshifts, masses, and star formation histories in the galaxy population withinthe \prospector\ Bayesian inference framework. In contrast with uniform priors,our model breaks an age-mass-redshift degeneracy, and thus reduces the meanbias error in masses from 0.3 to 0.1 dex, and in ages from 0.6 to 0.2 dex intests done on mock JWST observations. Notably, our model recovers redshifts atleast as accurately as the state-of-the-art photo-$z$ code \eazy\ in deep JWSTfields, but with two advantages: tailoring a model based on a particular surveyrenders mostly unnecessary given well-motivated priors; obtaining jointposteriors describing stellar, active galactic nuclei, gas, and dustcontributions becomes possible. We can now confidently use the jointdistribution to propagate full non-Gaussian redshift uncertainties intoinferred properties of the galaxy population.

The Kerr black hole solution is howeverprovisional as its behavior at infinity is incompatible with an expandinguniverse. Black hole models with realistic behavior at infinity predict thatthe gravitating mass of a black hole can increase with the expansion of theuniverse independently of accretion or mergers, in a manner that depends on theblack hole's interior solution. We test this prediction by considering thegrowth of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies over$0<z\lesssim2.5$. We find evidence for cosmologically coupled mass growth amongthese black holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98%confidence. The redshift dependence of the mass growth implies that, at$z\lesssim7$, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmologicalenergy density to Friedmann's equations. The continuity equation then requiresthat black holes contribute cosmologically as vacuum energy. We further showthat black hole production from the cosmic star formation history gives thevalue of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ measured by Planck while being consistent withconstraints from massive compact halo objects. We thus propose that stellarremnant black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy, explaining theonset of accelerating expansion at $z \sim 0.7$.",19

To this end, we employ Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics +N-body simulations to study idealised setups of equal- and unequal-mass mergerswith head-on collisions. Our simulations show that the ICM hardly affects theoffsets arising shortly after the first pericentre passage compared to DM-only(DMO) simulations. But later on, e.g. at the first apocentre, the offsets canbe amplified by the presence of the ICM. Furthermore, we find thatcross-sections small enough not to be excluded by measurements of the coresizes of relaxed galaxy clusters have a chance to produce observable offsets.We found that different DM models affect the DM distribution and also thegalaxy and and ICM distribution, including its temperature. Potentially, theposition of the shock fronts, combined with the brightest cluster galaxies(BCGs), provides further clues to the properties of DM. Overall our resultsdemonstrate that mergers of galaxy clusters at stages about the first apocentrepassage could be more interesting in terms of DM physics than those shortlyafter the first pericentre passage.

We investigate the prospects for observationallydetecting the surviving remnants of such mergers, focusing on the case ofmergers of Carbon-Oxygen WDs. For $\sim 10^4$ yr, the merger remnant isobservationally similar to an extreme AGB star evolving to become a massive WD.Identifying merger remnants is thus easiest in galaxies with high stellarmasses (high WD merger rate) and low star formation rates (low birth rate of$\sim 6-10 \,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ stars). Photometrically identifying mergerremnants is challenging even in these cases because the merger remnants appearsimilar to He stars and post-outburst classical novae. We propose that the mostpromising technique for discovering WD merger remnants is through their unusualsurrounding photoionized nebulae. We use CLOUDY photoionization calculations toinvestigate their unique spectral features. Merger remnants should produce weakhydrogen lines and strong carbon and oxygen recombination and fine-structurelines in the UV, optical and IR.

Aside from the bulk cluster motion, internal motions also lead to akSZ signal. In this work, we study the rotational kSZ effect caused by coherentlarge-scale motions of the cluster medium using cluster hydrodynamiccosmological simulations. To utilise the rotational kSZ as a cosmologicalprobe, simulations offer some of the most comprehensive data sets that caninform the modeling of this signal. In this work, we use the MACSIS data set tospecifically investigate the rotational kSZ effect in massive clusters. Basedon these models, we test stacking approaches and estimate the amplitude of thecombined signal with varying mass, dynamical state, redshift and map-alignmentgeometry. We find that the dark matter, galaxy and gas spins are generallymisaligned, an effect that can cause a sub-optimal estimation of the rotationalkSZ effect when based on galaxy catalogues. Furthermore, we providehalo-spin-mass scaling relations that can be used to build a statistical modelof the rotational kSZ. The rotational kSZ contribution, which is largest inmassive unrelaxed clusters ($\gtrsim$100 $\mu$K), could be relevant to studiesof higher-order CMB temperature signals, such as the moving lens effect. Thelimited mass range of the MACSIS sample strongly motivates an extendedinvestigation of the rotational kSZ effect in large-volume simulations torefine the modelling, particularly towards lower mass and higher redshift, andprovide forecasts for upcoming cosmological CMB experiments (e.g. SimonsObservatory, SKA-2) and X-ray observations (e.g. \textit{Athena}/X-IFU).",4

As a target sample, we usedall true, possible, and likely PNe available in the literature. Then, we lookedfor their matched Gaia DR3 sources that provide measurements of variability andRV. As a result, we detected the first large collection of trustworthyphotometric variability of 26 symbiotic stars (SySts) and 82 CSs. In this CSgroup, there are 24 sources already classified as true close binary CSs in theliterature. Hence, we discovered 58 new close binary CS candidates. This closebinary (CB) sample represents more than half of what is currently available inthe literature. In addition, we identified the radial velocities for 51 PNe. Toour knowledge, 24 of these were measured for the first time. The RVmeasurements predicted by Gaia, based on the Doppler shift of the CS absorptionlines, and those derived from nebular emission lines, show satisfactoryagreement except for a few extremely high-velocity PNe.",2

As a first step in our investigations we write down the simplestpossible conformally invariant gravitational action, constructed in Weylgeometry, and containing the Weyl scalar, and the strength of the Weyl vectoronly. By introducing an auxiliary scalar field, the theoretical model can bereformulated in the Riemann geometry as scalar-vector-tensor theory, containinga scalar field, and the Weyl vector, respectively. The field equations of thetheory are derived in the metric formalism, in the absence of matter. Aspecific static, spherically symmetric model, in which the Weyl vector has onlya radial component, is considered. In this case, an exact analytic solution ofthe gravitational field equations can be obtained. The behavior of the galacticrotation curves is also considered in detail, and it is shown that an effectivegeometric mass term, with an associated density profile, can also beintroduced. Three particular cases, corresponding to some specific functionalforms of the Weyl vector, are also investigated. A comparison of the model witha selected sample of galactic rotation curves is also performed when anexplicit breaking of conformal invariance is introduced, which allows the fixof the numerical values of the free parameters of the model. Our results showthat Weyl geometric models can be considered as a viable theoreticalalternative to the dark matter paradigm.",4

Although widely used, the validity of chemical and thermalequilibrium conditions is debatable in some of these highly dynamicalastrophysical environments. We aim to derive a kinetic nucleation model thatincludes the effects of thermal non-equilibrium by adopting differenttemperatures for nucleating species, and to quantify the impact of thermalnon-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation. Forward and backward rate coefficientsare derived as part of a collisional kinetic nucleation theory ansatz. Theendothermic backward rates are derived from the law of mass action in thermalnon-equilibrium. We consider elastic collisions as thermal equilibrium drivers.For homogeneous TiO2 nucleation and a gas temperature of 1250 K, we find thatdifferences in the kinetic cluster temperatures as small as 20 K increase theformation of larger TiO2 clusters by over an order of magnitude. An increase incluster temperature of around 20 K at gas temperatures of 1000 K can reduce theformation of a larger TiO2 cluster by over an order of magnitude. Our resultsconfirm and quantify the prediction of previous thermal non-equilibriumstudies. Small thermal non-equilibria can cause a significant change in thesynthesis of larger clusters. Therefore, it is important to use kineticnucleation models that include thermal non-equilibrium to describe theformation of clusters in environments where even small thermal non-equilibriacan be present.",4

We compare the X-ray surface brightness profilesof the eROSITA detected groups with the mean stacked profile of the undetectedlow-mass halos. Overall, we find that the undetected groups exhibit lessconcentrated X-ray surface brightness, dark matter, and galaxy distributionswith respect to the X-ray detected halos. Consistently with the low massconcentration, the magnitude gap indicates that these are younger systems. Thelater assembly time is confirmed by the bluer average color of the BCG and ofthe galaxy population with respect to the detected systems. They reside with ahigher probability in filaments while X-ray detected low-mass halos favor thenodes of the Cosmic Web. Because of the suppressed X-ray central emission, theundetected systems tend to be X-ray under-luminous at fixed halo mass, and tolie below the $L_X-M_{halo}$ relation. Interestingly, the X-ray detectedsystems inhabiting the nodes scatter the less around the relation, while thosein filaments tend to lie below it. We do not observe any strong relationbetween the properties of detected and undetected systems with the AGNactivity. The fraction of optically selected AGN in the galaxy population isconsistent in the two samples. More interestingly, the probability that the BCGhosts a radio AGN is lower in the undetected groups.

Theoretical progress over the last decade has focused onsimulations of this signal, given the nonlinear and nonlocal relation betweeninitial conditions and observables (21-cm or reionization maps). Here, instead,we propose an effective and fully analytic model for the 21-cm signal duringcosmic dawn. We take advantage of the exponential-like behavior of the localstar-formation rate density (SFRD) against densities at early times toanalytically find its correlation functions including nonlinearities. The SFRDacts as the building block to obtain the statistics of radiative fields (X-rayand Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes), and therefore the 21-cm signal. We implement thismodel as the public Python package Zeus21. This code can fully predict the21-cm global signal and power spectrum in $\sim 1$ s, with negligible memoryrequirements. When comparing against state-of-the-art semi-numericalsimulations from 21CMFAST we find agreement to 10\% precision in both the 21-cmglobal signal and power spectra, after accounting for a (previously missed)underestimation of adiabatic fluctuations in 21CMFAST. Zeus21 is modular,allowing the user to vary the astrophysical model for the first galaxies, andinterfaces with the cosmological code CLASS, which enables searches for beyondstandard-model cosmology in 21-cm data.

The pulse profiles are studied using different NICER observations,which implies that the profile is more or less sinusoidal with a single peakand the beaming patterns are mostly dominated by the pencil beam. The NICERspectra of the source are studied for different days of the outburst and can bewell described by a model consisting of a blackbody emission and power lawalong with a photoelectric absorption component. The variation of spectralparameters with luminosity is studied over the outburst. The photon index showsanti-correlation with luminosity below the critical luminosity, which impliesthat the source was accreting in the sub-critical accretion regime during theNICER observations. We also report the anti-correlation between pulsed fraction(PF) and luminosity of the 2S 1553--542 using NICER observations. The evolutionof spin-up rate with luminosity is studied during the outburst, which impliesthat both are strongly correlated.

For theAgekian-Anosova region we study black holes with mass unit 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$and allow one of the black holes to be maximally rotating. The sameconfigurations were tested without the inclusion of spin and we found thatsimulations that varied greatly from the spin to no spin cases had much closerapproaches between one of the Schwarzschild black holes and the Kerr blackhole. In the context of Burrau's problem, Pythagorean triangles with differentlinear scales were selected where the largest black hole in these systems weregiven spin vectors in normalised units where maximum is close to unity, rangingfrom 0 to about 0.95. Mass unit was also varied between 10$^{0}$ M$_{\odot}$ -10$^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$. It was found that while there was no distinctive effecton the number of two-body encounters nor the fraction of mergers, the lifetimesof the systems may have been affected - particularly in the intermediary massranges (10$^{4}$ M$_{\odot}$-10$^{7}$ M$_{\odot}$) in comparison to the zerospin problem.

Here we show this assumption fails in many cases withimportant implications for derived results. We developed a new method tomeasure the differential nebular attenuation among three kinds of transitions:the Balmer lines of hydrogen, high-ionization transitions, and low-ionizationtransitions. This method bins the observed data in a multidimensional spacespanned by attenuation-insensitive line ratios. Within each small bin, thevariations in line ratios are mainly driven by the variations in the nebularattenuation. This allows us to measure the nebular attenuation using bothforbidden lines and Balmer lines. We applied this method to a sample of 2.4million star-forming spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA. We found that the attenuationof high ionization lines and Balmer lines can be well described by a singleFitzpatrick (1999) extinction curve with $R_V=3.1$. However, no singleattenuation curve can simultaneously account for all three transitions. Thisstrongly suggests that different lines have different effective attenuations,likely because spectroscopy at kiloparsec resolutions mixes multiple regionswith different intrinsic line ratios and different levels of attenuation. As aresult, the assumption that different lines follow the same attenuation curvebreaks down. Using a single attenuation curve determined by Balmer lines tocorrect attenuation-sensitive forbidden line ratios could bias the nebularparameters derived by 0.06--0.25 dex at $A_V = 1$, depending on the details ofthe dust attenuation model. Observations of a statistically large sample of HII regions with high spatial resolutions and large spectral coverage are vitalfor improved modeling and deriving accurate corrections for this effect.",15

Theconfiguration used here is currently being tested in the shock tunnel at theNational Ignition Facility (NIF).

Our simulations indicate that thegrowth of the magnetic field, which accompanies the near-Saffman kinetic energydecay ($E_{\textrm{kin}} \propto t^{-1.15})$ without turbulence driving,exhibits slightly different characteristics as compared to periodic boxsimulations. Seemingly no distinct phases exist in its evolution, because theshock passage and time to observe the magnetic field amplification during theturbulence decay are very short ($\sim\!0.3$ of a turbulent turnover time).Yet, the growth rate is still consistent with those expected for compressive(curl-free) turbulence driving in subsonic, compressible turbulence.Phenomenological understanding of the dynamics of the magnetic and velocityfields are also elucidated via Lagrangian frequency spectra, which areconsistent with the expected inertial range scalings in the Eulerian-Lagrangianbridge.",2

We derive two formulae in full order withrespect to the gravitational field, one in terms of the gravitational mass $m$and the Einstein tensor and the other in terms of the orbital angular velocityand the Einstein tensor. These formulae reproduce the well-known ones for theprograde shift in the Schwarzschild spacetime. In a general case, the shiftdeviates from that in the vacuum spacetime due to a particular combination ofthe components of the Einstein tensor at the radius $r$ of the orbit. Theformulae give a retrograde shift due to the extended-mass effect in Newtoniangravity. In general relativity, in the weak-field regime near a massive object,the active gravitational mass density,$\rho_{A}=(\epsilon+p_{r}+2p_{t})/c^{2}$, plays an important role, where$\epsilon$, $p_{r}$, and $p_{t}$ are the energy density, the radial stress, andthe tangential stress of the matter field, respectively.

We study the amplification of both large- andsmall-scale correlated magnetic fields, corresponding to inflation- and phasetransition-generated PMFs, in a massive galaxy cluster. We employhigh-resolution magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations to resolvethe turbulent motions in the intracluster medium. We find that the turbulentamplification is more efficient for the large-scale inflationary models, whilethe phase transition-generated seed fields show moderate growth. Thedifferences between the models are imprinted on the spectral characteristics ofthe field (such as the amplitude and the shape of the magnetic power spectrum)and therefore on the final correlation length. We find a one order of magnitudedifference between the final strengths of the inflation- and phasetransition-generated magnetic fields, and a factor of 1.5 difference betweentheir final coherence scales. Thus, the final configuration of the magneticfield retains information about the PMF generation scenarios. Our findings haveimplications for future extragalactic Faraday rotation surveys with thepossibility of distinguishing between different magnetogenesis scenarios.",7
35,Investigating effects of dark matter on photon orbits and black hole shadows,"['Arshia Anjum', 'Misba Afrin', 'Sushant G. Ghosh']","17 pages, 16 figures, 6 tables. Accepted for publication in Physics of the Dark Universe",General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); High Energy Physics - Theory (hep-th),"We consider Kerr black holes (BHs) surrounded by perfect dark fluid matter(PFDM), with an additional parameter ($k$) because of PFDM, apart from mass($M$) and rotation parameter ($a$) -- the rotating PFDM BHs. We analyze thephoton orbits around PFDM BHs and naked singularities (NSs) and emphasise theeffect of PFDM on photon \emph{boomerangs}. Interestingly, the azimuthaloscillations first increase and then decrease for retrograde orbits, whereasthey first decrease and then increase for prograde orbits, with increasing $k$.Unlike in the Kerr NSs, photon \emph{boomerangs} can form around rotating PFDMNSs. We use the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational results forSchwarzschild shadow deviations of M87* and Sgr A*,$\delta_{M87^*}=-0.01\pm0.17$ and $\delta_{Sgr A^*} =-0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.09}~\text{(VLTI)},-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}~\text{(Keck)}$, toreport the upper bounds on the PFDM parameter: $0\leq k\leq 0.0792M$ and$k^{max}\in[0.0507M, 0.0611M]$ respectively. Together with the EHT bounds onthe shadows of Sgr A$^*$ and M87$^*$, our analysis concludes that a substantialpart of the rotating PFDM BH parameter space agrees with the EHT observations.Thus, one must consider the possibility of the rotating PFDM BHs being strongcandidates for the astrophysical BHs.",3
