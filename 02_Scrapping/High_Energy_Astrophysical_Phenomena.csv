The most luminous burstsare typically detected at moderate/high redshift, where the volume for seeingsuch rare events is maximized and the star-formation activity is greater thanat z = 0. For distant events, not all observations are feasible, such as at TeVenergies.Aims: Here we present a spectroscopic redshift measurement for theexceptional GRB 221009A, the brightest GRB observed to date with emissionextending well into the TeV regime.Methods: We used the X-shooter spectrograph at the ESO Very Large Telescope(VLT) to obtain simultaneous optical to near-IR spectroscopy of the burstafterglow 0.5 days after the explosion.Results: The spectra exhibit both absorption and emission lines from materialin a host galaxy at z = 0.151. Thus GRB 221009A was a relatively nearby burstwith a luminosity distance of 745 Mpc. Its host galaxy properties(star-formation rate and metallicity) are consistent with those of LGRB hostsat low redshift. This redshift measurement yields information on the energy ofthe burst. The inferred isotropic energy release, $E_{\rm iso} > 5 \times10^{54}$ erg, lies at the high end of the distribution, making GRB 221009A oneof the nearest and also most energetic GRBs observed to date. We estimate thatsuch a combination (nearby as well as intrinsically bright) occurs between onceevery few decades to once per millennium.",42

The archetypical blazar BL Lacprovided a unique opportunity to study spectral variations during an extendedstrong flaring episode from 2020-2021. During its brightest $\gamma$-ray state,the observed flux (0.1-300 GeV) reached up to$2.15\,\times\,10^{-5}\,\rm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, with sub-hour scalevariability. The synchrotron hump extended into the X-ray regime showing aminute-scale flare with an associated peak shift of inverse-Compton hump ingamma-rays. In shock acceleration models, a high Doppler factor value $>$100 isrequired to explain the observed rapid variability, change of state, and$\gamma$-ray peak shift. Assuming particle acceleration in mini-jets producedby magnetic reconnection during flares, on the other hand, alleviates theconstraint on required bulk Doppler factor. In such jet-in-jet models, observedspectral shift to higher energies (towards TeV regime) and simultaneous rapidvariability arises from the accidental alignment of a magnetic plasmoid withthe direction of the line of sight. We infer a magnetic field of$\sim0.6\,\rm{G}$ in a reconnection region located at the edge of BLR($\sim0.02\,\rm{pc}$). The scenario is further supported by log-normal fluxdistribution arising from merging of plasmoids in reconnection region.",10

This method uses the so-called z variable(difference between the total reconstructed and the simulated signals), whichis connected to the muon signal and is roughly independent of the zenith angle,but depends on the mass of the primary cosmic ray. Using a mock dataset builtfrom QGSJetII-04, we show that such a method allows us to reproduce the averagemuon signal from this dataset using Monte-Carlo events generated with theEPOS-LHC hadronic model, with accuracy better than 6%. As a consequence of thegood recovery of the muon signal for each primary included in the analysis,also the beta exponent can be obtained with accuracy of less than 1% for thestudied system.

We constrain the upper limit ofthe EBL density by fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of TeV BLLacs and find that our results are compatible with the published measurement,reaching 50 $\rm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. We also obtain that the EBL is notnecessarily transparent to high VHE photons. We fix the intrinsic spectralindex $\Gamma_i$ of TeV BL Lacs as 1.0 and 1.5 under observation evidence andmodel assumption. Comparing the EBL density given by galaxy count and $Spitzer$observations, we then obtain that 1ES 1101-232 has $\Gamma_i$ $\leq$ 1.0 and1ES 0229+200 should have $\Gamma_i$ not harder than 1.0. We demonstrate thatthe common radiation assumption of BL Lacs, in which the $\Gamma_i$ is softerthan 1.5, should be revisited. Furthermore, we propose that the upper EBLdensity could be given by fitting the hardest energy spectra of TeV BL Lacs.",8

Thenon-detection of significant gamma ray flux from these galaxies by Fermidisfavoured the IC/CMB interpretation of the high energy emission.

Theemission model is extrapolated to VHE energy and then compared with the CTAOsensitivity.

We use a non-thermal emission model to derive physicalparameters from the results.Results: We detect hard X-ray emission consistent with a power-law component.This is compatible with IC emission produced in the WCR for a magnetic field of100-160 mG and a fraction of ~1.5e-4 of the total wind kinetic power beingconverted into relativistic electron acceleration.Conclusions: This is the first time that the non-thermal emission from a CWBis detected both in radio and high energies. This allows us to derive the mostrobust constraints of the particle acceleration efficiency and magnetic fieldintensity in a CWB so far, reducing the typical uncertainty of a few orders ofmagnitude to just within a factor of two. This constitutes an important stepforward in our characterisation of the physical properties of CWBs.",8

We find: (1) The synchrotron spectrum in the DM model issimilar to that in the homogeneous turbulence (HT) model with very low magneticfield strength. However, the difference in the IC spectral component isrelatively more obvious between them, due to the significant change of thepostshock electron energy distribution with DM. (2) If the magnetic field decayfaster, there are less electrons cool fast, and the IC spectral componentbecomes weaker. (3) The LCs in the DM model decay steeper than in the HT model,and the spectral evolution and the LCs in the DM model is similar to the HTmodel where the magnetic field energy fraction decreases with observer time,$\epsilon_B(t) \propto t^{5\alpha_t /8}$. (4) The DM model can naturallyproduce a significant IC spectral component in TeV energy range, but due to theKlein-Nishina suppression the IC power cannot be far larger than thesynchrotron power.

We build a newenergy-conserving model of the accretion flow, SSsed, which is based on theprevious agnsed with complex Comptonisation. However, it is tuned to suit forstellar black holes by including a colour temperature correction, and allowinga little more freedom in the potential to compensate for uncertainties inrelativistic correction depending on the corona shape. The model is applied tohundreds of RXTE data of a black hole binary XTE J1550-564. It constrains themodel parameters of the innermost radii of the accretion flow, Rin, the outerradius of a hot inner flow which extends from Rin-Rhot and the outer radius ofthe softer (probably nonthermal) Comptonisation region extending fromRhot-Rcor. We showed that the outer radius of the combined Comptonised emissionregions, Rcor anti-correlates well with the central frequencies oflow-frequency QPOs detected during the same observations. The relation isremarkably consistent with the quantitative predictions of Lense-Thirringprecession of the entire Comptonisation regions for the assumed systemparameters.

The Kerr black hole solution is howeverprovisional as its behavior at infinity is incompatible with an expandinguniverse. Black hole models with realistic behavior at infinity predict thatthe gravitating mass of a black hole can increase with the expansion of theuniverse independently of accretion or mergers, in a manner that depends on theblack hole's interior solution. We test this prediction by considering thegrowth of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies over$0<z\lesssim2.5$. We find evidence for cosmologically coupled mass growth amongthese black holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98%confidence. The redshift dependence of the mass growth implies that, at$z\lesssim7$, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmologicalenergy density to Friedmann's equations. The continuity equation then requiresthat black holes contribute cosmologically as vacuum energy. We further showthat black hole production from the cosmic star formation history gives thevalue of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ measured by Planck while being consistent withconstraints from massive compact halo objects. We thus propose that stellarremnant black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy, explaining theonset of accelerating expansion at $z \sim 0.7$.",19

The gas dynamicsduring cluster mergers may also drive large-scale turbulence in the ICM whichin turn generates extended synchrontron sources known as radio halos. Thepresence of surface brightness edges in the thermal gas of clusters has beenestablished by a number of X-ray observations. In contrast, edges in radiohalos have been observed only in a handful of cases. Our goal is to search fornew radio surface brightness discontinuities in the ICM. We inspected theimages of the Bullet Cluster and the other 25 radio halos reported in theMeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey. To aid the identification of surfacebrightness discontinuities, we applied a gradient filtering edge detectionmethod to the radio images. We found that the adopted filtering technique ishelpful to identify surface brightness edges in radio images, allowing us toidentify at least one gradient in half of the radio halos studied. For theBullet Cluster, we found excellent agreement between the locations of the 4radio discontinuities detected and X-ray edges. This similarity informs us thatthere is substantial interplay between thermal and non-thermal components ingalaxy clusters. This interplay is likely due to the forzen-in ICM magneticfield which mediates the advection of cosmic rays while being dragged bythermal gas flows. We conclude that radio halos are shaped by dynamical motionsin the ICM and that they often display surface brightness discontinuitiesapparently co-located with edges in the thermal gas emission. Our resultsdemonstrate that new and future generations of radio telescopes will provide acomplementary approach to X-rays to efficiently detect shocks and cold frontsin the ICM.",5

We investigate the role of the intraclustermedium (ICM) and its influence on DM-galaxy offsets in self-interacting darkmatter (SIDM) models. To this end, we employ Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics +N-body simulations to study idealised setups of equal- and unequal-mass mergerswith head-on collisions. Our simulations show that the ICM hardly affects theoffsets arising shortly after the first pericentre passage compared to DM-only(DMO) simulations. But later on, e.g. at the first apocentre, the offsets canbe amplified by the presence of the ICM. Furthermore, we find thatcross-sections small enough not to be excluded by measurements of the coresizes of relaxed galaxy clusters have a chance to produce observable offsets.We found that different DM models affect the DM distribution and also thegalaxy and and ICM distribution, including its temperature. Potentially, theposition of the shock fronts, combined with the brightest cluster galaxies(BCGs), provides further clues to the properties of DM. Overall our resultsdemonstrate that mergers of galaxy clusters at stages about the first apocentrepassage could be more interesting in terms of DM physics than those shortlyafter the first pericentre passage. This may motivate further studies ofmergers at later evolutionary stages.",6

As a result, 2) nuclei canexist at higher pressures without dripping out neutrons.

We compare the X-ray surface brightness profilesof the eROSITA detected groups with the mean stacked profile of the undetectedlow-mass halos. Overall, we find that the undetected groups exhibit lessconcentrated X-ray surface brightness, dark matter, and galaxy distributionswith respect to the X-ray detected halos. Consistently with the low massconcentration, the magnitude gap indicates that these are younger systems. Thelater assembly time is confirmed by the bluer average color of the BCG and ofthe galaxy population with respect to the detected systems. They reside with ahigher probability in filaments while X-ray detected low-mass halos favor thenodes of the Cosmic Web. Because of the suppressed X-ray central emission, theundetected systems tend to be X-ray under-luminous at fixed halo mass, and tolie below the $L_X-M_{halo}$ relation. Interestingly, the X-ray detectedsystems inhabiting the nodes scatter the less around the relation, while thosein filaments tend to lie below it. We do not observe any strong relationbetween the properties of detected and undetected systems with the AGNactivity. The fraction of optically selected AGN in the galaxy population isconsistent in the two samples. More interestingly, the probability that the BCGhosts a radio AGN is lower in the undetected groups. We, thus, argue that theobserved differences between X-ray detected and undetected groups areascribable to the Cosmic Web, and its role in the halo assembly bias.

At higherenergies, the positron fraction is dominated by a small number of pulsars,making it difficult to reliably predict the shape of the expected positronfraction. The low-energy positron spectrum supports the conclusion that pulsarstypically transfer approximately $\eta \sim 5-20\%$ of their total spindownpower into the production of very high-energy electron-positron pairs,producing a spectrum of such particles with a hard spectral index, $\alpha \sim1.5-1.7$.

The dust transport anddestruction fractions are computed using our post-processing code Paperboats inwhich the acceleration of grains due to the magnetic field and a procedure thatallows partial grain vaporization have been newly implemented.

These formulae reproduce the well-known ones for theprograde shift in the Schwarzschild spacetime. In a general case, the shiftdeviates from that in the vacuum spacetime due to a particular combination ofthe components of the Einstein tensor at the radius $r$ of the orbit. Theformulae give a retrograde shift due to the extended-mass effect in Newtoniangravity. In general relativity, in the weak-field regime near a massive object,the active gravitational mass density,$\rho_{A}=(\epsilon+p_{r}+2p_{t})/c^{2}$, plays an important role, where$\epsilon$, $p_{r}$, and $p_{t}$ are the energy density, the radial stress, andthe tangential stress of the matter field, respectively.

38,Is a black hole shadow a reliable test of the no-hair theorem?,"['Kostas Glampedakis', 'George Pappas']",Accepted for publication as a Regular Article in Physical Review D,General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Capturing the image of the shadow cast by the event horizon of an illuminatedblack hole is, at the most basic level, an experiment of extreme lightdeflection in a strongly curved spacetime. As such, the properties of an imagedshadow can be used to probe the general relativistic Kerr nature ofastrophysical black holes. As an example of this prospect, it is commonlyasserted that a shadow can test the validity of the theory's famous `no hairtheorem' for the black hole's mass and spin multipole moments. In this paper,we assess this statement by calculating the shadow's equatorial radius inspacetimes with an arbitrary multipolar structure and within a slow rotationapproximation. We find that when moments higher than the quadrupole are takeninto account, the shadow acquires a high degree of degeneracy as a function ofthe deviation from the Kerr multipole moments. The results of our analysissuggest that dark objects with strongly non-Kerr multipolar structure couldnevertheless produce a Kerr-like shadow with its characteristic quasi-circularshape.",2
