0,C14 Automatic Imaging Telescope Photometry of GJ1214,"['Gregory W. Henry', 'Jacob L. Bean']","arXiv only posting, contact Greg Henry for access to the data",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"GJ1214b is the highest signal-to-noise sub-Neptune for atmospheric studies.Although most previous transmission spectroscopy measurements have revealed afrustratingly featureless spectrum, JWST observations are expected to give newinsights to this benchmark planet. We have performed photometric monitoring ofGJ1214 (the host star) to provide context for these observations. We find thatGJ1214 entered a period of relatively high brightness during 2021 and 2022.This implies that the JWST MIRI/LRS phase curve observation of GJ1214b in July2022 was obtained during an epoch of low activity for the spot-dominated hoststar. Like previous works, we are unable to definitively identify the star'srotation period. Nevertheless, we confirm that it is likely >50 days.",2
1,Non-perturbative investigation of low eccentricity exterior mean motion resonances,"['Renu Malhotra', 'Zherui Chen']","11 pages, many figures. In press at MNRAS",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Chaotic Dynamics (nlin.CD),"Mean motion resonances are important in the analysis and understanding of thedynamics of planetary systems. While perturbative approaches have been dominantin many previous studies, recent non-perturbative approaches have revealednovel properties in the low eccentricity regime for interior mean motionresonances of Jupiter in the fundamental model of the circular planarrestricted three body model. Here we extend the non-perturbative investigationto exterior mean motion resonances in the low eccentricity regime (up to about0.1) and for perturber mass in the range 5e-5 to 1e-3 (in units of the centralmass). Our results demonstrate that first order exterior resonances have twobranches at low eccentricity as well as low-eccentricity bridges connectingneighboring first order resonances. With increasing perturber mass, higherorder resonances dissolve into chaos whereas low order resonances persist withlarger widths in their radial extent but smaller azimuthal widths. For loworder resonances, we also detect secondary resonances arising from smallinteger commensurabilities between resonant librations and the synodicfrequency. These secondary resonances contribute significantly to generatingthe chaotic sea that typically occurs near mean motion resonances ofhigher-mass perturbers.",2
2,Accounting for non-ideal mixing effects in the hydrogen-helium equation of state,"['Saburo Howard', 'Tristan Guillot']",,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP),"The equation of state for hydrogen and helium is fundamental for studyingstars and giant planets. It has been shown that because of interactions atatomic and molecular levels, the behaviour of a mixture of hydrogen and heliumcannot be accurately represented by considering these elements separately. Thispaper aims at providing a simple method to account for interactions betweenhydrogen and helium in interior and evolution models of giant planets. Using onthe one hand ab initio simulations that involve a system of interactinghydrogen and helium particles and pure equations of state for hydrogen andhelium on the other, we derived the contributions in density and entropy of theinteractions between hydrogen and helium particles. We show that relativevariations of up to 15% in density and entropy arise when non-ideal mixing isaccounted for. These non-ideal mixing effects must be considered in interiormodels of giant planets based on accurate gravity field measurements,particularly in the context of variations in the helium-to-hydrogen ratio. Theyalso affect the mass-radius relation of exoplanets. We provide a table thatcontains the volume and entropy of mixing as a function of pressure andtemperature. This table is to be combined with pure hydrogen and pure heliumequations of state to obtain an equation of state that self-consistentlyincludes mixing effects for any hydrogen and helium mixing ratio and may beused to model the interior structure and evolution of giant planets to browndwarfs. Non-linear mixing must be included in accurate calculations of theequations of state of hydrogen and helium. Uncertainties on the equation ofstate still exist, however. Ab initio calculations of the behaviour of thehydrogen-helium mixture in the megabar regime for various compositions shouldbe performed in order to gain accuracy.",2

We have adapted TauREx3, the Bayesian retrieval suite, for theanalysis of near-infrared spectrophotometry from directly-imaged gas giantexoplanets and brown dwarfs. We demonstrate TauREx3's applicability tosub-stellar atmospheres by presenting results for brown dwarf benchmark GJ 570Dwhich are consistent with previous retrieval studies, whilst also exhibitingsystematic biases associated with the presence of alkali lines. We also presentresults for the cool exoplanet 51 Eri b, the first application of a freechemistry retrieval analysis to this object, using spectroscopic observationsfrom GPI and SPHERE. While our retrieval analysis is able to explainspectroscopic and photometric observations without employing cloud extinction,we conclude this may be a result of employing a flexible temperature-pressureprofile which is able to mimic the presence of clouds. We present Bayesianevidence for an ammonia detection with a 2.7$\sigma$ confidence, the firstindication of ammonia in an exoplanetary atmosphere. This is consistent withthis molecule being present in brown dwarfs of a similar spectral type. Wedemonstrate the chemical similarities between 51 Eri b and GJ 570D in relationto their retrieved molecular abundances. Finally, we show that overallretrieval conclusions for 51 Eri b can vary when employing different spectraldata and modelling components, such as temperature-pressure and cloudstructures.",15
4,Maps of secular resonances in the NEO region,"['M. Fenucci', 'G. F. Gronchi', 'B. Novaković']",Accepted for publication in A&A,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Mathematical Physics (math-ph),"Context. From numerical simulations, it is known that some secular resonancesmay affect the motion of near-Earth objects (NEOs). However, the specificlocation of the secular resonance inside the NEO region is not fully known,because the methods previously used to predict their location can not be usedfor highly eccentric orbits and when the NEOs cross the orbits of the planets.Aims. In this paper, we aim to map the secular resonances with the planetsfrom Venus to Saturn in the NEO region, even for high values of theeccentricity.Methods. We used an averaged semi-analytical model that can deal with orbitcrossing singularities for the computation of the secular dynamics of NEOs,from which we can obtain suitable proper elements and proper frequencies. Then,we computed the proper frequencies over a uniform grid in the proper elementsspace. Secular resonances are thus located by the level curves corresponding tothe proper frequencies of the planets.Results. We determined the location of the secular resonances with theplanets from Venus to Saturn, showing that they appear well inside the NEOregion. By using full numerical N-body simulations we also showed that thelocation predicted by our method is fairly accurate. Finally, we provided someindications about possible dynamical paths inside the NEO region, due to thepresence of secular resonances.",3

Lara and David Jewitt, World Scientific Publishing Co Pte Ltd",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP),"The great diversity of the thousands of planets known to date is proof of themultitude of ways in which formation and evolution processes can shape the lifeof planetary systems. Multiple formation and evolution paths, however, canresult in the same planetary architecture. Because of this, unveiling theindividual histories of planetary systems and their planets can prove achallenging task. The chemical composition of planets provides us with aguiding light for navigate this challenge, but to understand the information itcarries we need to properly link it to the chemical composition andcharacteristics of the environments in which the planets formed. To achievethis goal it is necessary to combine the information and perspectives providedby a growing number of different fields of study, spanning the whole lifecycleof stars and their planetary systems. The aim of this chapter is to provide theunifying perspective needed to understand and connect such diverse information,and illustrate the process through which we can decode the message containedinto the composition of planetary bodies.",1
6,The effect of thermal non-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation,"['Sven Kiefer', 'David Gobrecht', 'Leen Decin', 'Christiane Helling']","13 pages, 4 figures",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA); Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR),"Nucleation is considered to be the first step in dust and cloud formation inthe atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, exoplanets, and browndwarfs. In these environments dust and cloud particles grow to macroscopicsizes when gas phase species condense onto cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs).Understanding the formation processes of CCNs and dust in AGB stars isimportant because the species that formed in their outflows enrich theinterstellar medium. Although widely used, the validity of chemical and thermalequilibrium conditions is debatable in some of these highly dynamicalastrophysical environments. We aim to derive a kinetic nucleation model thatincludes the effects of thermal non-equilibrium by adopting differenttemperatures for nucleating species, and to quantify the impact of thermalnon-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation. Forward and backward rate coefficientsare derived as part of a collisional kinetic nucleation theory ansatz. Theendothermic backward rates are derived from the law of mass action in thermalnon-equilibrium. We consider elastic collisions as thermal equilibrium drivers.For homogeneous TiO2 nucleation and a gas temperature of 1250 K, we find thatdifferences in the kinetic cluster temperatures as small as 20 K increase theformation of larger TiO2 clusters by over an order of magnitude. An increase incluster temperature of around 20 K at gas temperatures of 1000 K can reduce theformation of a larger TiO2 cluster by over an order of magnitude. Our resultsconfirm and quantify the prediction of previous thermal non-equilibriumstudies. Small thermal non-equilibria can cause a significant change in thesynthesis of larger clusters. Therefore, it is important to use kineticnucleation models that include thermal non-equilibrium to describe theformation of clusters in environments where even small thermal non-equilibriacan be present.",4

Brown']",Published in Planetary Science Journal,Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP),"The tenuous atmospheres of the Galilean satellites are sourced from theirsurfaces and produced by a combination of plasma-surface interactions andthermal processes. Though thin, these atmospheres can be studied via theirauroral emissions, and most work to date has focused on their aurora at UVwavelengths. Here we present the first detections of Ganymede's and Callisto'soptical aurorae, as well detections of new optical auroral lines at Europa,based on observations of the targets over ten Jupiter eclipses from 1998 to2021 with Keck/HIRES. We present measurements of OI emission at 6300/6364,5577, 7774, and 8446 A and place upper limits on hydrogen at 6563 A. Theseconstitute the first detections of emissions at 7774 and 8446 A at a planetarybody other than Earth. The simultaneous measurement of multiple emission linesprovides robust constraints on atmospheric composition. We find that theeclipse atmospheres of Europa and Ganymede are composed predominantly of O2with average column densities of (4.1 \pm 0.1) x 10^{14} cm^{-2} and (4.7 \pm0.1) x 10^{14} cm^{-2}, respectively. We find weak evidence for H2O in Europa'sbulk atmosphere at an H2O/O2 ratio of $\sim$0.25, and place only an upper limiton H2O in Ganymede's bulk atmosphere, corresponding to H2O/O2 < 0.6. The columndensity of O2 derived for Callisto is (4.0 \pm 0.9 x 10^{15} cm^{-2} for anassumed electron density of 0.15 cm^{-3}, but electron properties at Callisto'sorbit are very poorly constrained.",5

Thedifferent lines present in stellar spectra are created by several species,which are non-uniformly affected by stellar variability features such as spotsor faculae. Stellar variability distorts the shape of the spectral absorptionlines from which precise RVs are measured, posing one of the main problems inthe study of exoplanets. In this work we aim to study how the spectral linespresent in M dwarfs are independently impacted by stellar activity. We usedCARMENES optical spectra of six active early- and mid-type M dwarfs to computeline-by-line RVs and study their correlation with several well-studied proxiesof stellar activity. We are able to classify spectral lines based on theirsensitivity to activity in five M dwarfs displaying high levels of stellaractivity. We further used this line classification to compute RVs withactivity-sensitive lines and less sensitive lines, enhancing or mitigatingstellar activity effects in the RV time series. For specific sets of the leastactivity-sensitive lines, the RV scatter decreases by ~ 2 to 5 times theinitial one, depending on the star. Finally, we compare these lines in thedifferent stars analysed, finding the sensitivity to activity to vary from starto star. Despite the high density of lines and blends present in M dwarfstellar spectra, we find that a line-by-line approach is able to deliverprecise RVs. Line-by-line RVs are also sensitive to stellar activity effects,and they allow for an accurate selection of activity-insensitive lines tomitigate activity effects in RV. However, we find stellar activity effects tovary in the same insensitive lines from star to star.",20

Here, wemeasure the chaotic emissivity function (or equivalently, the absorptivity)through simulations. More precisely, we follow millions of scattering eventsonly up to the point when it can be decided whether the scattering is regularor chaotic. In this way, we measure a tri-variate absorptivity function. Usingit, we determine the flux-based prediction for the chaotic outcome distributionover both binary binding energy and angular momentum, and we find goodagreement with the measured distribution. This constitutes a detailedconfirmation of the flux-based theory, and demonstrates a considerablereduction in computation to determine the chaotic outcome distribution.",3

Previous studies of Jupiterhinted at periodic behavior that was non-seasonal, as well as dynamicalrelationships between tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures. However,these observations were made over time frames shorter than Jupiter's orbit orthey used sparse sampling. We derived upper-tropospheric (300-mbar)temperatures over 40 years, extending those studies to cover several orbits ofJupiter, revealing unexpected results. Periodicities of 4, 7 8-9 and 10-14years were discovered that involved different latitude bands and seemdisconnected from seasonal changes in solar heating. Anti-correlations ofvariability in opposite hemispheres were particularly striking at 16, 22 and 30degrees from the equator. Equatorial temperature variations are alsoanticorrelated with those 60-70 km above. Such behavior suggests a top-downcontrol of equatorial tropospheric temperatures from stratospheric dynamics.Realistic future global climate models must address the origins of thesevariations in preparation for their extension to a wider array of gas-giantexoplanets.",12

Stevenson']","24 pages, 9 figures, Published in the Astronomical Journal (AJ)",Earth and Planetary Astrophysics (astro-ph.EP),"Though the global atmospheres of hot Jupiters have been extensively studiedusing phase curve observations, the level of time variability in these data isnot well constrained.

(2017). We find nosignificant time variability between these three phase curves, which spantimescales of weeks to years. The three observations are best fit by a singlephase curve with an eclipse depth of 3907 +- 85 ppm, a dayside-integratedbrightness temperature of 1479 +- 13 K, a nightside-integrated brightnesstemperature of 755 +- 46 K, and an eastward-shifted peak of 10.4 +- 1.8degrees. To model our observations, we performed 3D general circulation modelsimulations of WASP-43b with simple cloud models of various vertical extents.In comparing these simulations to our observations, we find that WASP-43blikely has a cloudy nightside that transitions to a relatively cloud-freedayside. We estimate that any change in WASP-43bs vertical cloud thickness ofmore than three pressure scale heights is inconsistent with our observed upperlimit on variation. These observations, therefore, indicate that WASP-43bsclouds are stable in their vertical and spatial extent over timescales up toseveral years. These results strongly suggest that atmospheric propertiesderived from previous, single Spitzer phase curve observations of hot Jupiterslikely show us the equilibrium properties of these atmospheres.",11

We analyzetwo broadband light curves generated for the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, coveringwavelength ranges of 2.70-3.72 micron and 3.82-5.15 micron, respectively. Bothlight curves exhibit minimal systematics, with approximately linear drifts inthe baseline flux level of 30 ppm/hr (NRS1) and 10 ppm/hr (NRS2). Assuming asimple brightness map for the planet described by a low-order sphericalharmonic dipole, our light curve fits suggest that the phase curve peakscoincide with orbital phases $3.36 \pm 0.11$ deg (NRS1) and $2.66 \pm 0.12$ deg(NRS2) prior to mid-eclipse. This is consistent with the strongest daysideemission emanating from eastward of the substellar point.

We thencompute the dynamical tidal response for Jupiter interior models including bothstably stratified and convective regions. These calculations show thatresonances involving mixed waves with both gravito-inertial and purely inertialcharacter are capable of explaining a discrepancy between observations andhydrostatic calculations of Jupiter's response to tidal forcing by Io. Thisresult contrasts with recent work that excluded Jupiter's rotationalflattening, and opens the door to resonances involving a wider range ofinternal oscillation modes than previously considered.",1

Couldsome of them have survived over the aeons of dynamical evolution to the presentday? The dynamical conditions are harsh for exomoons in such systems because ofthe greater influence of the host star and of the tidal torque it exerts on theplanet. We investigate the stability niches of exomoons around hundredsinnermost exoplanets for which the needed parameters are known today, anddetermine the conditions of these moons' long-term survival. General lower andupper bounds on the exomoon survival niches are derived for orbitalseparations, periods, and masses. The fate of an exomoon residing in astability niche depends on the initial relative rate of the planet's rotationand on the ability of the moon to synchronise the planet by overpowering thetidal action from the star. State of the art models of tidal dissipation andsecular orbital evolution are applied to a large sample of known exoplanetsystems with their estimated physical parameters. We show that in someplausible scenarios, exomoons can prevent close exoplanets from spiraling intotheir host stars, thus extending these planets' lifetimes. This is achievedwhen exomoons synchronise the rotation of their parent planets, overpoweringthe tidal action from the stars. Massive moons are more likely to survive andto maintain a high rotation rate of their host planets (higher than theseplanets' mean motion).",2
