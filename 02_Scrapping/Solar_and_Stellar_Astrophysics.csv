Submitted to MNRAS",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"We report spectroscopic and photometric follow-up of a dormant black hole(BH) candidate from Gaia DR3. We show that the system, which we call Gaia BH2,contains a $\sim 1M_{\odot}$ red giant and a dark companion with mass $M_2 =8.9\pm 0.3\,M_{\odot}$ that is very likely a BH. The orbital period, $P_{\rmorb} = 1277$ days, is much longer than that of any previously studied BHbinary. Our radial velocity (RV) follow-up over a 6-month period spans most ofthe orbit's dynamic range in RV and is in excellent agreement with predictionsof the Gaia solution. UV imaging and high-resolution optical spectra rule outall plausible luminous companions that could explain the orbit. The star is abright ($G=12.3$), slightly metal-poor ($\rm [Fe/H]=-0.22$) low-luminositygiant ($T_{\rm eff}=4600\,\rm K$; $R = 7.9\,R_{\odot}$; $\log\left[g/\left({\rmcm\,s^{-2}}\right)\right] = 2.6$). The binary's orbit is moderately eccentric($e=0.52$). The giant is strongly enhanced in $\alpha-$elements, with $\rm[\alpha/Fe] = +0.26$, but the system's Galactocentric orbit is typical of thethin disk. We obtained X-ray and radio nondetections of the source nearperiastron, which support BH accretion models in which the net accretion rateat the horizon is much lower than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. At a distanceof 1.16 kpc, Gaia BH2 is the second-nearest known BH, after Gaia BH1. Its orbit-- like that of Gaia BH1 -- seems too wide to have formed through commonenvelope evolution. Gaia BH1 and BH2 have orbital periods at opposite edges ofthe Gaia DR3 sensitivity curve, perhaps hinting at a bimodal intrinsic perioddistribution for wide BH binaries. Dormant BH binaries like Gaia BH1 and GaiaBH2 likely significantly outnumber their close, X-ray bright cousins, but theirformation pathways remain uncertain.",21
1,Observational Signatures of Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf Merger Remnants,"['Philippe Z. Yao', 'Eliot Quataert', 'Andy Goulding']","12 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, submitted to MNRAS",Solar and Stellar Astrophysics (astro-ph.SR); Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA),"Many double white dwarf (WD) mergers likely do not lead to a promptthermonuclear explosion. We investigate the prospects for observationallydetecting the surviving remnants of such mergers, focusing on the case ofmergers of Carbon-Oxygen WDs. For $\sim 10^4$ yr, the merger remnant isobservationally similar to an extreme AGB star evolving to become a massive WD.Identifying merger remnants is thus easiest in galaxies with high stellarmasses (high WD merger rate) and low star formation rates (low birth rate of$\sim 6-10 \,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ stars). Photometrically identifying mergerremnants is challenging even in these cases because the merger remnants appearsimilar to He stars and post-outburst classical novae. We propose that the mostpromising technique for discovering WD merger remnants is through their unusualsurrounding photoionized nebulae. We use CLOUDY photoionization calculations toinvestigate their unique spectral features. Merger remnants should produce weakhydrogen lines and strong carbon and oxygen recombination and fine-structurelines in the UV, optical and IR. With integral field spectrographs, we predictthat hundreds of candidates are detectable in M87 and other nearby massivegalaxies. Dust somewhat reduces the optical line emission for nebula radii$\lesssim 10^{17}$ cm, but the sources spend most of their time with largerradii when dust is less important. Our models roughly reproduce the WISE nebulasurrounding the Galactic WD merger candidate IRAS 00500+6713; we predictdetectable [Ne VI] and [Mg VII] lines with JWST but that the mid-IR WISEemission is dominated by dust not fine-structure lines.",3

Thedifferent lines present in stellar spectra are created by several species,which are non-uniformly affected by stellar variability features such as spotsor faculae. Stellar variability distorts the shape of the spectral absorptionlines from which precise RVs are measured, posing one of the main problems inthe study of exoplanets. In this work we aim to study how the spectral linespresent in M dwarfs are independently impacted by stellar activity. We usedCARMENES optical spectra of six active early- and mid-type M dwarfs to computeline-by-line RVs and study their correlation with several well-studied proxiesof stellar activity. We are able to classify spectral lines based on theirsensitivity to activity in five M dwarfs displaying high levels of stellaractivity. We further used this line classification to compute RVs withactivity-sensitive lines and less sensitive lines, enhancing or mitigatingstellar activity effects in the RV time series. For specific sets of the leastactivity-sensitive lines, the RV scatter decreases by ~ 2 to 5 times theinitial one, depending on the star. Finally, we compare these lines in thedifferent stars analysed, finding the sensitivity to activity to vary from starto star. Despite the high density of lines and blends present in M dwarfstellar spectra, we find that a line-by-line approach is able to deliverprecise RVs. Line-by-line RVs are also sensitive to stellar activity effects,and they allow for an accurate selection of activity-insensitive lines tomitigate activity effects in RV. However, we find stellar activity effects tovary in the same insensitive lines from star to star.",20

This study is twofold: (1) searching for new close binary CSs candidatesto better understand how binarity affects the formation and evolution of PNe;and (2) extending the sample size of known RV of PNe in order to understandtheir kinematics and the dynamics of the Milky Way. As a target sample, we usedall true, possible, and likely PNe available in the literature. Then, we lookedfor their matched Gaia DR3 sources that provide measurements of variability andRV. As a result, we detected the first large collection of trustworthyphotometric variability of 26 symbiotic stars (SySts) and 82 CSs. In this CSgroup, there are 24 sources already classified as true close binary CSs in theliterature. Hence, we discovered 58 new close binary CS candidates. This closebinary (CB) sample represents more than half of what is currently available inthe literature. In addition, we identified the radial velocities for 51 PNe. Toour knowledge, 24 of these were measured for the first time. The RVmeasurements predicted by Gaia, based on the Doppler shift of the CS absorptionlines, and those derived from nebular emission lines, show satisfactoryagreement except for a few extremely high-velocity PNe.",2

Chromospheric fibrils are thin and elongated structures that connectnearby photospheric magnetic field concentrations of opposite polarities. Aims.We assess the possibilities and drawbacks related to the use of currentinstrumentation and inversion techniques to infer the thermodynamic structureof chromospheric fibrils. Methods. We employed spectroscopic observationsobtained in the Ca ii 854.2 nm line with the CRISP instrument at the Swedish1-m Solar Telescope and in coordination with observations in the ultraviolet Mgii h & k lines taken with the IRIS satellite. We studied the temperaturesensitivity of these chromospheric lines to properly invert their spectralprofiles with the Stockholm inversion Code and determine the temperature,line-of-sight velocity, and microturbulent velocity of manually tracedchromospheric fibrils present in the field of view. Results. Fibril-likestructures show a very particular dependence of their temperature as a functionof the position along their length. Their temperatures at the detectedfootpoints are, on average, 300 K higher than the temperature at the midpoint.The temperature variation appears to be almost symmetrical in shape, withpartially traced fibrils showing a similar trend for the temperature variation.Additionally, the response of the Ca ii 854.2 nm line core to variations of thetemperature for the inverted models of the atmosphere in fibril areas seems tobe insufficient to properly resolve the aforementioned temperature structure.Only the addition of more temperature sensitive lines such as the Mg ii h & klines would make it possible to properly infer the thermodynamic properties ofchromospheric fibrils. Comparisons between the results obtained here and inprevious studies focused on bright Ca ii K fibrils yield great similaritiesbetween these structures in terms of their temperature.",3

We find thatGJ1214 entered a period of relatively high brightness during 2021 and 2022.This implies that the JWST MIRI/LRS phase curve observation of GJ1214b in July2022 was obtained during an epoch of low activity for the spot-dominated hoststar.

We demonstrate TauREx3's applicability tosub-stellar atmospheres by presenting results for brown dwarf benchmark GJ 570Dwhich are consistent with previous retrieval studies, whilst also exhibitingsystematic biases associated with the presence of alkali lines. We also presentresults for the cool exoplanet 51 Eri b, the first application of a freechemistry retrieval analysis to this object, using spectroscopic observationsfrom GPI and SPHERE. While our retrieval analysis is able to explainspectroscopic and photometric observations without employing cloud extinction,we conclude this may be a result of employing a flexible temperature-pressureprofile which is able to mimic the presence of clouds. We present Bayesianevidence for an ammonia detection with a 2.7$\sigma$ confidence, the firstindication of ammonia in an exoplanetary atmosphere. This is consistent withthis molecule being present in brown dwarfs of a similar spectral type. Wedemonstrate the chemical similarities between 51 Eri b and GJ 570D in relationto their retrieved molecular abundances.

More precisely, we follow millions of scattering eventsonly up to the point when it can be decided whether the scattering is regularor chaotic. In this way, we measure a tri-variate absorptivity function. Usingit, we determine the flux-based prediction for the chaotic outcome distributionover both binary binding energy and angular momentum, and we find goodagreement with the measured distribution.

In these environments dust and cloud particles grow to macroscopicsizes when gas phase species condense onto cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs).Understanding the formation processes of CCNs and dust in AGB stars isimportant because the species that formed in their outflows enrich theinterstellar medium. Although widely used, the validity of chemical and thermalequilibrium conditions is debatable in some of these highly dynamicalastrophysical environments. We aim to derive a kinetic nucleation model thatincludes the effects of thermal non-equilibrium by adopting differenttemperatures for nucleating species, and to quantify the impact of thermalnon-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation. Forward and backward rate coefficientsare derived as part of a collisional kinetic nucleation theory ansatz. Theendothermic backward rates are derived from the law of mass action in thermalnon-equilibrium. We consider elastic collisions as thermal equilibrium drivers.For homogeneous TiO2 nucleation and a gas temperature of 1250 K, we find thatdifferences in the kinetic cluster temperatures as small as 20 K increase theformation of larger TiO2 clusters by over an order of magnitude. An increase incluster temperature of around 20 K at gas temperatures of 1000 K can reduce theformation of a larger TiO2 cluster by over an order of magnitude. Our resultsconfirm and quantify the prediction of previous thermal non-equilibriumstudies. Small thermal non-equilibria can cause a significant change in thesynthesis of larger clusters. Therefore, it is important to use kineticnucleation models that include thermal non-equilibrium to describe theformation of clusters in environments where even small thermal non-equilibriacan be present.",4

Moreover, the interaction betweeninterplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and high-speed stream (HSS) hasbeen observed on several occasions. However, can such interaction generate anAW? What will be the nature of AW in such a scenario remains an open question.To answer it, we have investigated an ICME-HSS interaction event observed on21st October 1999 at 1 AU by Wind spacecraft. We have used the Walén test toidentify AW and estimated Elsasser variables to find the characteristics of theAWs. We explicitly find that ICME were dominant with Sunward AWs, whereas thetrailing HSS has strong anti-Sunward AW. We suggest that the ICME-HSSinteraction deforms the MC of the ICME, resulting in the AWs inside the MC. Inaddition, the existence of reconnection within the ICME early stage can also bethe leading cause of the origin of AW within it.",10

Important dust destruction processes include thermal andkinetic sputtering as well as fragmentation and grain vaporization. In thepresent study, we focus on the effect of magnetic fields on the destructionprocesses. We have performed magneto-hydrodynamical simulations using AstroBEARto model a shock wave interacting with an ejecta clump. The dust transport anddestruction fractions are computed using our post-processing code Paperboats inwhich the acceleration of grains due to the magnetic field and a procedure thatallows partial grain vaporization have been newly implemented. For theoxygen-rich supernova remnant Cassiopeia A we found a significantly lower dustsurvival rate when magnetic fields are aligned perpendicular to the shockdirection compared to the non-magnetic case. For a parallel field alignment,the destruction is also enhanced but at a lower level. The survival fractionsdepend sensitively on the gas density contrast between the clump and theambient medium and on the grain sizes. For a low-density contrast of $100$,e.g., $5\,$nm silicate grains are completely destroyed while the survivalfraction of $1\,\mu$m grains is $86\,$per cent. For a high-density contrast of$1000$, $95\,$per cent of the $5\,$nm grains survive while the survivalfraction of $1\,\mu$m grains is $26\,$per cent. Alternative clump sizes or dustmaterials (carbon) have non-negligible effects on the survival rate but have alower impact compared to density contrast, magnetic field strength, and grainsize.",5

We argue that GLEAM-XJ1627 is a highly-magnetized object consistent with a magnetar (an ultra longperiod magnetar - ULPM), and demonstrate it is unlikely to be either amagnetically or a rotationally-powered white dwarf. By studying these sourcestogether with previously detected objects, we find there are at least a handfulof promising candidates for Galactic ULPMs. The detections of these objectsimply a substantial number, $N \gtrsim 13000$ and $N \gtrsim 500$ for PSRJ0901--4046 like and GLEAM-X J1627 like objects, respectively, within ourGalaxy. These source densities, as well as cooling age limits fromnon-detection of thermal X-rays, Galactic offsets, timing stability and dipolespindown limits, all imply the ULPM candidates are substantially older thanconfirmed Galactic magnetars and that their formation channel is a common one.Their existence implies widespread survival of magnetar-like fields for severalMyr, distinct from the inferred behaviour in confirmed Galactic magnetars.ULPMs may also constitute a second class of FRB progenitors which couldnaturally exhibit very long periodic activity windows. Finally, we show thatexisting radio campaigns are biased against detecting objects like these anddiscuss strategies for future radio and X-ray surveys to identify more suchobjects.

Thus, we present here novelthree-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a laser-driven shockpropagating into a stratified, multiphase medium, to investigate the post-shockturbulent magnetic field amplification via the turbulent dynamo. Theconfiguration used here is currently being tested in the shock tunnel at theNational Ignition Facility (NIF). In order to probe the statistical propertiesof the post-shock turbulent region, we use $384 \times 512 \times 384$ tracersto track its evolution through the Lagrangian framework, thus providing ahigh-fidelity analysis of the shocked medium. Our simulations indicate that thegrowth of the magnetic field, which accompanies the near-Saffman kinetic energydecay ($E_{\textrm{kin}} \propto t^{-1.15})$ without turbulence driving,exhibits slightly different characteristics as compared to periodic boxsimulations. Seemingly no distinct phases exist in its evolution, because theshock passage and time to observe the magnetic field amplification during theturbulence decay are very short ($\sim\!0.3$ of a turbulent turnover time).Yet, the growth rate is still consistent with those expected for compressive(curl-free) turbulence driving in subsonic, compressible turbulence.Phenomenological understanding of the dynamics of the magnetic and velocityfields are also elucidated via Lagrangian frequency spectra, which areconsistent with the expected inertial range scalings in the Eulerian-Lagrangianbridge.",2
