0,The AFISS web platform for the correlation of high-energy transient events,"['A. Addis', 'A. Bulgarelli', 'N. Parmiggiani', 'J. Rodi', 'A. Bazzano']","4 pages, 4 figures, Astronomical Data Analysis Software and System XXXII (31 October-4 November 2022)",Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM),"In the multi-messenger era, facilities share their results with thescientific community through networks such as the General Coordinates Networkto study transient phenomena (e.g., Gamma-ray bursts) and implement real-timeanalysis pipelines to detect transient events, reacting to science alertsreceived from other observatories. The fast analysis of transient events iscrucial for detecting counterparts of gravitational waves and neutrinocandidate events. In this context, collecting scientific results from differenthigh-energy satellites observing the same transient event represents a key stepin improving the statistical significance of the high-energy candidate events.This project aims to develop a system and a web platform to share informationand scientific results of transient events between high-energy satellites withINAF participation (AGILE, FERMI, INTEGRAL and SWIFT). The AFISS platformimplements the COMET VO- Event broker and provides a web portal where the usersvisualize the list of transient events detected by multi-messenger facilitiesand received through the GCN. The web portal could show, for each event, asummary of the scientific results shared by the real-time analysis pipelinesand a list of time-correlated transient events. In addition, the platform isready to receive results from participating facilities on sub-threshold events(STE) that cannot be shared with the community due to the low statisticalsignificance. If the platform finds a time correlation between two or moreSTEs, it can promote them to science alerts. The web interface shows the listof STEs with possible time correlation with other STEs or science alerts. Theplatform notifies the users with an email when a new transient event isreceived.",5

ATLAS-Teide will be built by theInstituto de Astrofisica de Canarias (IAC) and will be operated as part of theATLAS network in the framework of an operation and science exploitationagreement between the IAC and the ATLAS team at University of Hawaii.ATLAS-Teide will be the first ATLAS unit based on commercial on the shelf(COTS) components. Its design is modular, each module (building block) consistof four Celestron RASA 11 telescopes that point to the same sky field, equippedwith QHY600PRO CMOS cameras on an equatorial Direct Drive mount. Each module isequivalent to a 56cm effective diameter telescope and provides a 7.3 deg^2field of view and a 1.26 arcsec/pix plate scale. ATLAS-Teide will consist offour ATLAS modules in a roll-off roof building. This configuration allows tocover the same sky area of the actual ATLAS telescopes.The first ATLAS module was installed in November 2022 in an existingclamshell at the TO. This module (ATLAS-P) is being used as a prototype to testthe system capabilities, develop the needed software (control, imageprocessing, etc.) and complete the fully integration of ATLAS-Teide in theATLAS network. The preliminary results of the tests are presented here, and thebenefits of the new ATLAS design are discussed.",5

The LISA mission couldidentify the tens of thousands of binaries over years of observation and willbe subject to the confusion noise around 1 mHz yielded by the unresolvedsources. Beyond LISA, there are several missions have been proposed to observeGWs in the sub-mHz range where the galactic foreground is expected to beoverwhelming the instrumental noises. In this study, we investigate thedetectability of sub-mHz GW missions to detect the galactic double white dwarf(DWD) binaries and evaluate the confusion noise produced by the undistinguishedDWDs. This confusion noise could also be viewed as a stochastic GW foregroundand be effectively observed in the sub-mHz band. The parameter determinationsfor the modeled foreground are examined by employing different detectorsensitivities and population models. By assuming the determined foregroundscould be subtracted from the data, we evaluate the residuals which are expectedto have power spectral densities two orders of magnitude lower than theoriginals data.",4
4,A Deep Learning Technique to Control the Non-linear Dynamics of a Gravitational-wave Interferometer,"['Peter Xiangyuan Ma', 'Gabriele Vajente']",,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics (astro-ph.IM); General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology (gr-qc),"In this work we developed a deep learning technique that successfully solvesa non-linear dynamic control problem. Instead of directly tackling the controlproblem, we combined methods in probabilistic neural networks and aKalman-Filter-inspired model to build a non-linear state estimator for thesystem. We then used the estimated states to implement a trivial controller forthe now fully observable system. We applied this technique to a crucialnon-linear control problem that arises in the operation of the LIGO system, aninterferometric gravitational-wave observatory. We demonstrated in simulationthat our approach can learn from data to estimate the state of the system,allowing a successful control of the interferometer's mirror . We alsodeveloped a computationally efficient model that can run in real time at highsampling rate on a single modern CPU core, one of the key requirements for theimplementation of our solution in the LIGO digital control system. We believethese techniques could be used to help tackle similar non-linear controlproblems in other applications.",2

In thiswork, we present a new method to calculate the factor by which the muon signalobtained via Monte-Carlo simulations must be rescaled to match the data, aswell as the beta exponent from the Heitler-Matthews model which governs thenumber of muons found in an extensive air shower as a function of the mass andthe energy of the primary cosmic ray. This method uses the so-called z variable(difference between the total reconstructed and the simulated signals), whichis connected to the muon signal and is roughly independent of the zenith angle,but depends on the mass of the primary cosmic ray. Using a mock dataset builtfrom QGSJetII-04, we show that such a method allows us to reproduce the averagemuon signal from this dataset using Monte-Carlo events generated with theEPOS-LHC hadronic model, with accuracy better than 6%. As a consequence of thegood recovery of the muon signal for each primary included in the analysis,also the beta exponent can be obtained with accuracy of less than 1% for thestudied system. Detailed simulations show a dependence of the beta exponent onhadronic interaction properties, thus the determination of this parameter isimportant for understanding the muon deficit problem.",11

We have adapted TauREx3, the Bayesian retrieval suite, for theanalysis of near-infrared spectrophotometry from directly-imaged gas giantexoplanets and brown dwarfs. We demonstrate TauREx3's applicability tosub-stellar atmospheres by presenting results for brown dwarf benchmark GJ 570Dwhich are consistent with previous retrieval studies, whilst also exhibitingsystematic biases associated with the presence of alkali lines. We also presentresults for the cool exoplanet 51 Eri b, the first application of a freechemistry retrieval analysis to this object, using spectroscopic observationsfrom GPI and SPHERE. While our retrieval analysis is able to explainspectroscopic and photometric observations without employing cloud extinction,we conclude this may be a result of employing a flexible temperature-pressureprofile which is able to mimic the presence of clouds. We present Bayesianevidence for an ammonia detection with a 2.7$\sigma$ confidence, the firstindication of ammonia in an exoplanetary atmosphere. This is consistent withthis molecule being present in brown dwarfs of a similar spectral type. Wedemonstrate the chemical similarities between 51 Eri b and GJ 570D in relationto their retrieved molecular abundances. Finally, we show that overallretrieval conclusions for 51 Eri b can vary when employing different spectraldata and modelling components, such as temperature-pressure and cloudstructures.",15

Calibration inaccuracies can compromise the sensitivityof these measurements to the effect that a detection of the EoR is precluded.An alternative to standard analysis techniques makes use of the closure phase,which allows one to bypass antenna-based direction-independent calibration.Similarly to standard approaches, we use a delay spectrum technique to searchfor the EoR signal. Using 94 nights of data observed with Phase I of theHydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), we place approximate constraintson the 21 cm power spectrum at $z=7.7$. We find at 95% confidence that the 21cm EoR brightness temperature is $\le$(372)$^2$ ""pseudo"" mK$^2$ at 1.14""pseudo"" $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, where the ""pseudo"" emphasises that these limits are tobe interpreted as approximations to the actual distance scales and brightnesstemperatures. Using a fiducial EoR model, we demonstrate the feasibility ofdetecting the EoR with the full array. Compared to standard methods, theclosure phase processing is relatively simple, thereby providing an importantindependent check on results derived using visibility intensities, or related.",83

Based on the Local Geometric Index ofthe galaxies, we identify their local environments to be void, sheet, filamentor cluster. We find that the Grand-designs are mostly located in denseenvironments like clusters and filaments, whereas the Flocculents lie in sparseenvironments in voids and sheets. A $p$-value $<$ $10 ^{-10}$ from aKolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that our results are statisticallysignificant at $99.9\%$ confidence level. Further, we note that denseenvironments with large tidal flows are dominated by the Grand-designs.Metal-poor environments, such as sheets and voids, with a high abundance of gasclouds, on the other hand, are mostly populated by the Flocculents.",3

The detector operates in two modes: depleting at 77Kbefore cooling, or directly cooling to 5.2 K and applying different biasvoltages. Results indicated lower binding energy of charge states in the secondmode, at zero field and under an electric field, suggesting different chargestates formed under different operating modes.

Current and upcoming JWST imagingwill potentially detect galaxies out to $z \sim 20$, creating a new urgency inthe quest to infer accurate photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) for individualgalaxies from their spectral energy distributions, as well as masses, ages andstar formation rates. Here we illustrate the utility of informed priorsencoding previous observations of galaxies across cosmic time in achievingthese goals. We construct three joint priors encoding empirical constraints ofredshifts, masses, and star formation histories in the galaxy population withinthe \prospector\ Bayesian inference framework. In contrast with uniform priors,our model breaks an age-mass-redshift degeneracy, and thus reduces the meanbias error in masses from 0.3 to 0.1 dex, and in ages from 0.6 to 0.2 dex intests done on mock JWST observations. Notably, our model recovers redshifts atleast as accurately as the state-of-the-art photo-$z$ code \eazy\ in deep JWSTfields, but with two advantages: tailoring a model based on a particular surveyrenders mostly unnecessary given well-motivated priors; obtaining jointposteriors describing stellar, active galactic nuclei, gas, and dustcontributions becomes possible. We can now confidently use the jointdistribution to propagate full non-Gaussian redshift uncertainties intoinferred properties of the galaxy population. This model,``\prospector-$\beta$'', is intended for fitting galaxy photometry where theredshift is unknown, and will be instrumental in ensuring the maximum sciencereturn from forthcoming photometric surveys with JWST.

Keckobservatory on different observing nights spread over three years (2018-2020).These results, combined with other ancillary data, such as high-resolutionimages of the lens systems, and time delays, are necessary to increase thesample size of the quasar-galaxy lens systems for which the Hubble constant canbe measured, using the time-delay strong lensing method, hence increasing theprecision of its inference. Typically, the 2D spectra of the quasar-galaxy lenssystems get spatially blended due to seeing by ground-based observations. As aresult, the extracted lensing galaxy (deflector) spectra become significantlycontaminated by quasar light, which affects the ability to extract meaningfulinformation about the deflector. To account for spatial blending and extractless contaminated and higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 1D spectra of thedeflectors, a forward modeling method has been implemented. From the extractedspectra, we have measured redshifts using prominent absorption lines and singleaperture velocity dispersions using the penalized pixel fitting code pPXF.

It is found that the strongcorrelation between the $\rho_{t}$ and the scalar meson mass $m_{\sigma}$strikingly overwhelms the uncertainty of the nuclear equation of state in theRHAn models, in contrast to the usual awareness that $\rho_{t}$ ispredominantly sensitive to the isovector nuclear potential and symmetry energy.The accurate extraction of $\rho_{t}$ through the future gravitational wavemeasurements can thus provide a strong constraint on the longstandinguncertainty of $m_{\sigma}$, which is of significance to better infer thevacuum property. As an astrophysical implication, it suggests that thecorrelation between $\rho_t$ and $m_\sigma$ is very favorable to reconcile thedifficulty in reproducing the large crustal moment of inertia for the pulsarglitches with the well constrained symmetry energy.",5
