The Kerr black hole solution is howeverprovisional as its behavior at infinity is incompatible with an expandinguniverse. Black hole models with realistic behavior at infinity predict thatthe gravitating mass of a black hole can increase with the expansion of theuniverse independently of accretion or mergers, in a manner that depends on theblack hole's interior solution. We test this prediction by considering thegrowth of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies over$0<z\lesssim2.5$. We find evidence for cosmologically coupled mass growth amongthese black holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98%confidence. The redshift dependence of the mass growth implies that, at$z\lesssim7$, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmologicalenergy density to Friedmann's equations. The continuity equation then requiresthat black holes contribute cosmologically as vacuum energy. We further showthat black hole production from the cosmic star formation history gives thevalue of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ measured by Planck while being consistent withconstraints from massive compact halo objects. We thus propose that stellarremnant black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy, explaining theonset of accelerating expansion at $z \sim 0.7$.",19
1,Surface brightness discontinuities in radio halos. Insights from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey,"['Andrea Botteon', 'Maxim Markevitch', 'Reinout J. van Weeren', 'Gianfranco Brunetti', 'Timothy W. Shimwell']","10 pages, 5 figures, 1 table (excluding Appendixes). Abstract abridged to meet arXiv requirements. Submitted to A&A",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO); High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE),"Dynamical motions in the ICM can imprint distinctive features on the X-rayimages that map the thermal emission from clusters, such as sharp surfacebrightness discontinuities due to shocks and cold fronts. The gas dynamicsduring cluster mergers may also drive large-scale turbulence in the ICM whichin turn generates extended synchrontron sources known as radio halos. Thepresence of surface brightness edges in the thermal gas of clusters has beenestablished by a number of X-ray observations. In contrast, edges in radiohalos have been observed only in a handful of cases. Our goal is to search fornew radio surface brightness discontinuities in the ICM. We inspected theimages of the Bullet Cluster and the other 25 radio halos reported in theMeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey. To aid the identification of surfacebrightness discontinuities, we applied a gradient filtering edge detectionmethod to the radio images. We found that the adopted filtering technique ishelpful to identify surface brightness edges in radio images, allowing us toidentify at least one gradient in half of the radio halos studied. For theBullet Cluster, we found excellent agreement between the locations of the 4radio discontinuities detected and X-ray edges. This similarity informs us thatthere is substantial interplay between thermal and non-thermal components ingalaxy clusters. This interplay is likely due to the forzen-in ICM magneticfield which mediates the advection of cosmic rays while being dragged bythermal gas flows. We conclude that radio halos are shaped by dynamical motionsin the ICM and that they often display surface brightness discontinuitiesapparently co-located with edges in the thermal gas emission. Our resultsdemonstrate that new and future generations of radio telescopes will provide acomplementary approach to X-rays to efficiently detect shocks and cold frontsin the ICM.",5

We investigate the role of the intraclustermedium (ICM) and its influence on DM-galaxy offsets in self-interacting darkmatter (SIDM) models. To this end, we employ Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics +N-body simulations to study idealised setups of equal- and unequal-mass mergerswith head-on collisions. Our simulations show that the ICM hardly affects theoffsets arising shortly after the first pericentre passage compared to DM-only(DMO) simulations. But later on, e.g. at the first apocentre, the offsets canbe amplified by the presence of the ICM. Furthermore, we find thatcross-sections small enough not to be excluded by measurements of the coresizes of relaxed galaxy clusters have a chance to produce observable offsets.We found that different DM models affect the DM distribution and also thegalaxy and and ICM distribution, including its temperature. Potentially, theposition of the shock fronts, combined with the brightest cluster galaxies(BCGs), provides further clues to the properties of DM. Overall our resultsdemonstrate that mergers of galaxy clusters at stages about the first apocentrepassage could be more interesting in terms of DM physics than those shortlyafter the first pericentre passage. This may motivate further studies ofmergers at later evolutionary stages.",6
3,Revisiting oldest stars as cosmological probes,"['Cimatti A.', 'Moresco M']","10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables (including appendix). Submitted to ApJL",Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Despite the tremendous advance of observational cosmology, the value of theHubble constant ($H_0$) is still controversial (the so called ``Hubbletension'') because of the inconsistency between local/late-time measurementsand those derived from the cosmic microwave background. As the age of theUniverse is very sensitive to $H_0$, we explored whether the present-day oldeststars could place independent constraints on the Hubble constant. To thispurpose, we selected from the literature the oldest objects (globular clusters,stars, white dwarfs, ultra-faint and dwarf spheroidal galaxies) with accurateage estimates. Adopting a conservative prior on their formation redshifts ($11\leq z_{\rm f} \leq 30$) and assuming $\Omega_{\rm M} = 0.3 \pm 0.02$, wedeveloped a method based on Bayesian statistics to estimate the Hubbleconstant. We selected the oldest objects ($>13.3$ Gyr), and estimated $H_0$both for each of them individually and for the average ages of homogeneoussubsamples. Statistical and systematic uncertainties were properly taken intoaccount. The constraints based on individual ages indicate that $H_0<70.6$km/s/Mpc when selecting the most accurate estimates. If the ages are averagedand analyzed independently for each subsample, the most stringent constraintsimply $H_0<73.0$ with a probability of 93.2\% and errors around 2.5 km/s/Mpc.We also constructed an ``accuracy matrix'' to assess how the constraints on$H_0$ become more stringent with further improvements in the accuracy ofstellar ages and $\Omega_{\rm M}$. The results show the high potential of theoldest stars as independent and competitive cosmological probes.",2

We includea stochastic background of astrophysical origin in our search and properlyaccount for constraints on the curvature power spectrum from the overproductionof primordial black holes (PBHs). We find that the International PTA DataRelease 2 significantly favors the astrophysical model for its reportedcommon-spectrum process, over the curvature-induced background. On the otherhand, the two interpretations fit the NANOgrav 12.5 years dataset equally well.We then set new upper limits on the amplitude of the curvature power spectrumat small scales.

In this work, we instead perform afrequentist analysis using the profile likelihood in order to assess the impactof prior volume effects on the constraints. We constrain the maximal fractionof NEDE $f_\mathrm{NEDE}$, finding $f_\mathrm{NEDE}=0.076^{+0.040}_{-0.035}$ at$68 \%$ CL with our baseline dataset and similar constraints using either datafrom SPT-3G, ACT or full-shape large-scale structure, showing a preference over$\Lambda$CDM even in the absence of a SH0ES prior on $H_0$.

Including the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, we obtain$f_\mathrm{NEDE}=0.136^{+0.024}_{-0.026}$ at $68 \%$ CL. Furthermore, wecompare NEDE with the Early Dark Energy (EDE) model, finding similarconstraints on the maximal energy density fractions and $H_0$ in the twomodels.

Aside from the bulk cluster motion, internal motions also lead to akSZ signal. In this work, we study the rotational kSZ effect caused by coherentlarge-scale motions of the cluster medium using cluster hydrodynamiccosmological simulations. To utilise the rotational kSZ as a cosmologicalprobe, simulations offer some of the most comprehensive data sets that caninform the modeling of this signal. In this work, we use the MACSIS data set tospecifically investigate the rotational kSZ effect in massive clusters. Basedon these models, we test stacking approaches and estimate the amplitude of thecombined signal with varying mass, dynamical state, redshift and map-alignmentgeometry. We find that the dark matter, galaxy and gas spins are generallymisaligned, an effect that can cause a sub-optimal estimation of the rotationalkSZ effect when based on galaxy catalogues. Furthermore, we providehalo-spin-mass scaling relations that can be used to build a statistical modelof the rotational kSZ. The rotational kSZ contribution, which is largest inmassive unrelaxed clusters ($\gtrsim$100 $\mu$K), could be relevant to studiesof higher-order CMB temperature signals, such as the moving lens effect. Thelimited mass range of the MACSIS sample strongly motivates an extendedinvestigation of the rotational kSZ effect in large-volume simulations torefine the modelling, particularly towards lower mass and higher redshift, andprovide forecasts for upcoming cosmological CMB experiments (e.g. SimonsObservatory, SKA-2) and X-ray observations (e.g. \textit{Athena}/X-IFU).",4

Using all-sky radio maps andstacking on clusters and filaments, we have detected the polarization signatureof the synchrotron emission with polarization fractions >= 20%, which is bestexplained by the organization of local magnetic fields by strong shock wavesboth at the cluster peripheries and between clusters.

In this work, we take a stepforward and apply the statistics to the biased tracers of LSS, i.e. thegalaxies, and in redshift space. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis andquantify the constraining power of the MFs by using the Molino mock galaxycatalogs, which are constructed based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD)framework with parameters for the SDSS $M_r < -21.5$ and -22 galaxy samples.

We perform the analyses with ray-tracing simulations consideringdifferent sets of cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$. Atheoretical model to calculate the abundance of high peaks based on steepnessis also presented, which can well describe the main trend of the peakdistribution from simulations. We employ $\Delta\chi^2$ and Fisher analyses tostudy the cosmological dependence of the two peak statistics using our limitedsets of simulations as well as our theoretical model. Within our considerationswithout including potential systematic effects, the results show that thesteepness statistics tends to have higher sensitivities to the cosmologicalparameters than the peak height statistics and this advantage is diluted withthe increase of the shape noise. Using the theoretical model, we investigatethe physical reasons accounting for the different cosmological informationembedded in the two statistics. Our analyses indicate that the projectioneffect from large-scale structures plays an important role to enhance the gainfrom the steepness statistics. The redshift and cosmology dependence of darkmatter halo density profiles also contributes to the differences between thetwo statistics.",3

We compare the X-ray surface brightness profilesof the eROSITA detected groups with the mean stacked profile of the undetectedlow-mass halos. Overall, we find that the undetected groups exhibit lessconcentrated X-ray surface brightness, dark matter, and galaxy distributionswith respect to the X-ray detected halos. Consistently with the low massconcentration, the magnitude gap indicates that these are younger systems. Thelater assembly time is confirmed by the bluer average color of the BCG and ofthe galaxy population with respect to the detected systems. They reside with ahigher probability in filaments while X-ray detected low-mass halos favor thenodes of the Cosmic Web. Because of the suppressed X-ray central emission, theundetected systems tend to be X-ray under-luminous at fixed halo mass, and tolie below the $L_X-M_{halo}$ relation. Interestingly, the X-ray detectedsystems inhabiting the nodes scatter the less around the relation, while thosein filaments tend to lie below it. We do not observe any strong relationbetween the properties of detected and undetected systems with the AGNactivity. The fraction of optically selected AGN in the galaxy population isconsistent in the two samples. More interestingly, the probability that the BCGhosts a radio AGN is lower in the undetected groups.

Here, instead,we propose an effective and fully analytic model for the 21-cm signal duringcosmic dawn. We take advantage of the exponential-like behavior of the localstar-formation rate density (SFRD) against densities at early times toanalytically find its correlation functions including nonlinearities. The SFRDacts as the building block to obtain the statistics of radiative fields (X-rayand Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes), and therefore the 21-cm signal. We implement thismodel as the public Python package Zeus21. This code can fully predict the21-cm global signal and power spectrum in $\sim 1$ s, with negligible memoryrequirements. When comparing against state-of-the-art semi-numericalsimulations from 21CMFAST we find agreement to 10\% precision in both the 21-cmglobal signal and power spectra, after accounting for a (previously missed)underestimation of adiabatic fluctuations in 21CMFAST. Zeus21 is modular,allowing the user to vary the astrophysical model for the first galaxies, andinterfaces with the cosmological code CLASS, which enables searches for beyondstandard-model cosmology in 21-cm data.

We find that large, metal-rich galaxies with high starformation rates are more likely to have gravitational wave (GW) events comparedto younger, more metal poor galaxies. Our simulation with the default inputparameters predicts a higher local merger rate density compared to the thirdgravitational wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) prediction from LIGO, VIRGO andKAGRA. This is due to short coalescence times, low metallicities and an highformation rate of stars at low redshift in the galaxy simulation, whichproduces more BBHs that merge within the age of the Universe compared toobservations. We identify alternate remnant mass models that more accuratelyreproduce the observed volumetric rate and provide updated fits to the mergerrate distribution as a function of redshift. We then investigate the relativefraction of GW events in our simulation volume that are in observable hostgalaxies from different upcoming photometric and spectroscopic surveys,determining which of those are more ideal for tracing host galaxies with highmerger rates. The implications of this work can be utilised for numerousapplications, including for constraining stellar evolution models, betterinforming follow-up programs, and placing more informative priors on potentialhost galaxies when measuring cosmological parameters such as the Hubbleconstant.",4

The vacuum energy magnifies the modes entering thehorizon before its domination, making them potentially observable, and theresulting transfer function reflects the phase changes and energy contents. Todetermine the transfer function, we follow the curvature perturbation from welloutside the horizon during radiation domination to well outside the horizonduring vacuum domination and evaluate it on a constant radiation densityhypersurface, as is appropriate for the case of thermal inflation. The shape ofthe transfer function is determined by the ratio of vacuum energy to radiationat matter-radiation equality, which we denote by $\upsilon$, and has twocharacteristic scales, $k_{\rm a}$ and $k_{\rm b}$, corresponding to thehorizon sizes at matter radiation equality and the beginning of the inflation,respectively. If $\upsilon \ll 1$, the universe experiences radiation, matterand vacuum domination eras and the transfer function is flat for $k \ll k_{\rmb}$, oscillates with amplitude $1/5$ for $ k_{\rm b} \ll k \ll k_{\rm a}$ andoscillates with amplitude $1$ for $k \gg k_{\rm a}$.

Current observations provide tight constraints on themotion of matter, through the so-called redshift-space distortions, but theyonly provide a measurement of the sum of the spatial and temporal distortions,via gravitational lensing. In this Letter, we develop a method to measure thetime distortion on its own. We show that the coming generation of galaxysurveys, like the Square Kilometer Array, will allow us to measure thedistortion of time with an accuracy of 10-30%. Such a measurement will beessential to test deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model in a fullymodel-independent way. In particular, it can be used to compare the spatial andtemporal distortions of space-time and to unambiguously distinguish betweenmodifications of gravity and dark fifth forces acting on dark matter.",2

Typically, the 2D spectra of the quasar-galaxy lenssystems get spatially blended due to seeing by ground-based observations. As aresult, the extracted lensing galaxy (deflector) spectra become significantlycontaminated by quasar light, which affects the ability to extract meaningfulinformation about the deflector. To account for spatial blending and extractless contaminated and higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) 1D spectra of thedeflectors, a forward modeling method has been implemented. From the extractedspectra, we have measured redshifts using prominent absorption lines and singleaperture velocity dispersions using the penalized pixel fitting code pPXF.

We employhigh-resolution magnetohydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulations to resolvethe turbulent motions in the intracluster medium. We find that the turbulentamplification is more efficient for the large-scale inflationary models, whilethe phase transition-generated seed fields show moderate growth. Thedifferences between the models are imprinted on the spectral characteristics ofthe field (such as the amplitude and the shape of the magnetic power spectrum)and therefore on the final correlation length. We find a one order of magnitudedifference between the final strengths of the inflation- and phasetransition-generated magnetic fields, and a factor of 1.5 difference betweentheir final coherence scales. Thus, the final configuration of the magneticfield retains information about the PMF generation scenarios.

For the six models, we measurecosmological parameters and study whether or not pairs of the data sets aremutually consistent in these models. Half of these models allow the lensingconsistency parameter $A_L$ to be an additional free parameter, while the otherthree have $A_L = 1$. The tilted spatially-flat models assume the usualprimordial spatial inhomogeneity power spectrum. The tilted non-flat modelsassume either the primordial power spectrum used in the Planck group analyses[Planck $P(q)$] or a recently computed power spectrum [new $P(q)$]. In thetilted non-flat models with $A_L=1$ we find differences between P18 data andnon-CMB data cosmological parameter constraints, which are large enough to ruleout the Planck $P(q)$ model at 3$\sigma$ but not the new $P(q)$ model. Whileboth P18 data and non-CMB data separately favor a closed geometry whenP18+non-CMB data are jointly analyzed the evidence in favor of non-flathypersurfaces subsides. Differences between P18 data and non-CMB datacosmological constraints subside when $A_L$ is allowed to vary. From the mostrestrictive P18+lensing+non-CMB data combination we get almostmodel-independent constraints and find that the $A_L>1$ option is preferredover the $\Omega_k<0$ one, with the $A_L$ parameter, for all models, beinglarger than unity by $\sim 2.5\sigma$. According to the deviance informationcriterion, in the P18+lensing+non-CMB analysis, the varying $A_L$ option is onthe verge of being strongly favored over the $A_L=1$ one, which could indicatea problem for the standard tilted flat $\Lambda$CDM model (Abridged abstract).",3

For reasonablemodel parameters, we find that we can obtain good agreement with the measuredpositron fraction up to energies of $E_e \sim 300 \, {\rm GeV}$. At higherenergies, the positron fraction is dominated by a small number of pulsars,making it difficult to reliably predict the shape of the expected positronfraction. The low-energy positron spectrum supports the conclusion that pulsarstypically transfer approximately $\eta \sim 5-20\%$ of their total spindownpower into the production of very high-energy electron-positron pairs,producing a spectrum of such particles with a hard spectral index, $\alpha \sim1.5-1.7$. Such pulsars typically spindown on a timescale on the order of $\tau\sim 10^4 \, {\rm years}$.

Transition Edge Sensors (TES) and Microwave KineticInductance Detectors (MKID) are the predominant detector technologies ofcryogenic detector array based CMB instruments that search for primordialB-Modes. In this paper we propose another type of cryogenic detector to be usedfor CMB survey: A magnetic microbolometer (MMB) that is based on a paramagnetictemperature sensor. It is an adaption of state-of-the-art metallic magneticcalorimeters (MMCs) that are meanwhile a key technology for high resolution$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$ and X-ray spectroscopy as well as the study ofneutrino mass. The effort to adapt MMCs for CMB surveys is triggered by theirlack of Johnson noise associated with the detector readout, the possibility ofstraightforward calibration and higher dynamic range given it possesses a broadand smooth responsivity dependence with temperature and the absence of Jouledissipation which simplifies the thermal design. A brief proof of concept casestudy is analyzed, taking into account typical constraints in CMB measurementsand reliable microfabrication processes. The results show that MMBs provide apromising technology for CMB polarization survey as their sensitivity can betuned for background limited detection of the sky while simultaneouslymaintaining a low time response to avoid distortion of the point-sourceresponse of the telescope. As the sensor technology and its fabricationtechniques are compatible with TES based bolometric detector arrays, a changeof detector technology would even come with very low cost.",13
33,Role of magnetic fields in the formation of direct collapse black holes,"['Muhammad A. Latif', 'Dominik R. G. Schleicher', 'Sadegh Khochfar']","To be published ApJ, comments are still welcome",High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena (astro-ph.HE); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"Direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) are the leading candidates for the originof the first supermassive black holes. However, the role of magnetic fieldsduring their formation is still unclear as none of the previous studies hasbeen evolved long enough to assess their impact during the accretion phase.Here, we report the results from a suite of 3D cosmologicalmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations which are evolved for 1.6 Myrscomparable to the expected lifetime of supermassive stars (SMSs). Our findingssuggest that magnetic fields are rapidly amplified by strong accretion shocksirrespective of the initial magnetic field strength and reach the saturationstate. They stabilize the accretion disks and significantly reducefragmentation by enhancing the Jeans mass in comparison with purehydrodynamical runs. Although the initial clump masses are larger in MHD runs,the rapid coalescence of clumps in non-MHD cases due to the higher degree offragmentation results in similar masses. Overall, the central clumps havemasses of $\rm 10^5~M_{\odot}$ and the mean mass accretion rates of $\rm \sim0.1 ~M_{\odot}/yr$ are similar in both MHD and non-MHD cases. The multiplicityof SMSs is significantly reduced in MHD simulations. Such strongly amplifiedmagnetic fields are expected to launch Jets and outflows which may be detectedwith upcoming radio telescopes.",3
34,Updated Constraints on Primordial Black Hole Evaporation,"['Mrunal Korwar', 'Stefano Profumo']","13 pages, 2 figures, references added",High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph); Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics (astro-ph.CO),"The Hawking evaporation process, leading to the production of detectableparticle species, constrains the abundance of light black holes, presumably ofprimordial origin. Here, we reconsider and correct constraints from softgamma-ray observations, including of the gamma-ray line, at 511 keV, producedby electron-positron pair-annihilation, where positrons originate from blackhole evaporation. First, we point out that the INTEGRAL detection of the LargeMagellanic Cloud provides one of the strongest bounds attainable with presentobservations; and that future MeV gamma-ray telescopes, such as GECCO, willgreatly enhance such constraints. Second, we discuss issues with previouslimits from the isotropic flux at 511 keV and we provide updated, robustconstraints from recent measurements of the diffuse Galactic soft gamma-rayemission and from the isotropic soft gamma-ray background.",2
